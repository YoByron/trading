# Publish Blog Skill

Publishes blog posts to both **GitHub Pages** and **Dev.to** with proper formatting.

## Usage

```bash
# With explicit topic
/publish-blog "Iron Condor Backtesting Results"

# Auto-generate from recent context
/publish-blog
```

## What It Does

1. **Generates a blog post** with proper structure:
   - What prompt/task was given
   - What was accomplished
   - Tech stack used
   - Why the approach worked

2. **Saves to GitHub Pages** (`docs/_posts/`) with Jekyll frontmatter

3. **Publishes to Dev.to** if `DEVTO_API_KEY` is available

4. **Commits and pushes** to GitHub

## Blog Post Structure

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Title Here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
categories: [engineering, trading, ai]
tags: [relevant, tags, here]
---

## Jekyll Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `layout` | Always "post" | `post` |
| `title` | Post title (quoted) | `"Day 90: System Complete"` |
| `date` | ISO timestamp | `2026-01-28 15:30:00` |
| `categories` | Post categories | `[engineering, lessons-learned]` |
| `tags` | Searchable tags | `[iron-condors, phil-town, python]` |

## Dev.to Integration

The skill checks for `DEVTO_API_KEY` environment variable:

- **If set**: Posts to Dev.to with:
  - Title from Jekyll frontmatter
  - Tags: `trading`, `ai`, `machinelearning`, `python`
  - Series: "AI Trading Daily Reports"
  - Canonical URL pointing to GitHub Pages

- **If not set**: Skips Dev.to, only publishes to GitHub Pages

## Execution Steps

When invoked, the skill:

1. **Gather Context**
   - Check recent git commits
   - Check current branch changes
   - Read recent conversation context

2. **Generate Content**
   - Create title from topic or context
   - Structure post with standard sections
   - Include code snippets where relevant

3. **Save to GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   # Filename format: YYYY-MM-DD-slug-title.md
   docs/_posts/2026-01-28-iron-condor-backtesting.md
   ```

4. **Publish to Dev.to** (if API key available)
   ```python
   requests.post(
       "https://dev.to/api/articles",
       headers={"api-key": DEVTO_API_KEY},
       json={"article": {...}}
   )
   ```

5. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add docs/_posts/
   git commit -m "feat(blog): Publish: <title>"
   git push
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `DEVTO_API_KEY` | No | Dev.to API key for cross-posting |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes* | For pushing commits (*uses existing auth) |
