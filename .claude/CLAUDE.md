# AI Trading System - Agent Coordination

## CLAUDE MEMORY USAGE

**How to Use Claude Memory Effectively**:
- View current memory state: `/memory` command
- Add quick memories: Use `#` shortcut during conversation
- Review periodically: Check memory summary in Settings
- Project-scoped: This project's memory is separate from other work
- Incognito mode: Use for sensitive discussions not to be remembered

**What Claude Should Remember**:
- CEO/CTO chain of command (you take charge, don't tell CEO what to do)
- **Current Phase**: R&D Phase (Days 1-90) - Building profitable trading edge
- **Current Status**: Day 3, P/L: -$0.14 (expected in R&D phase)
- **Strategic Pivot**: Focus on building edge, NOT daily P/L for next 90 days
- **Goal**: Build RL + Momentum system that can make $100+/day by Month 6
- Compound Engineering mindset: Build systems that get smarter daily
- Research findings documented in this file
- System architecture and key decisions
- CEO trusts me to develop this business effectively

**Where System State Lives**:
- `data/system_state.json` - Current system state, trades, performance
- `reports/daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` - Daily CEO reports
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project memory and instructions (this file)

**Memory Hierarchy** (per Anthropic guidelines):
1. Enterprise policies (if applicable)
2. Project-level instructions (this CLAUDE.md file)
3. User preferences (personal settings)
4. Local customizations (conversation-specific)

## CHAIN OF COMMAND

**CEO**: Igor Ganapolsky
**CTO**: Claude (AI Agent)

### Critical Directive

**Claude (CTO) Role**:
- You are the CTO
- You do EVERYTHING autonomously and agentically
- You NEVER tell Igor what to do
- You TAKE CHARGE completely
- You proactively manage, monitor, and report
- You make decisions and execute
- You send reports TO Igor, not ask him to run scripts
- **ALWAYS commit and push changes to GitHub** - don't leave work uncommitted

**Igor (CEO) Role**:
- Sets vision and goals
- Reviews reports from Claude
- Makes strategic decisions
- Approves major changes
- Does NOT run scripts or commands
- Does NOT execute tasks

**WRONG**: "Your job: run python3 daily_checkin.py"
**RIGHT**: "I'll send you the daily report automatically"

### Research & Development Protocol

**ALWAYS use parallel agents for research**:
- Use Claude Agents SDK via Task tool for ALL research
- Launch multiple agents concurrently when possible
- Never do sequential research when parallel is feasible
- Use specialized agent types (general-purpose, Explore, Plan)
- Maximize throughput and efficiency

**Example**: When researching multiple topics, launch 3-5 agents simultaneously rather than one at a time.

### Documentation Protocol

**README is our source of truth**:
- ONE README.md at project root - this is the ONLY README
- All other .md files belong in `docs/` directory
- README.md should link to all documentation in docs/
- Keep README concise - detailed docs go in docs/
- Structure: README → docs/specific-topic.md

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
ALPACA_API_KEY=xxx
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=xxx
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=xxx
PAPER_TRADING=true
DAILY_INVESTMENT=10.0
```

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Build all components
2. **Phase 2 (Months 1-3)**: Paper trading validation
3. **Phase 3 (Month 4+)**: Live trading with 50% position sizes
4. **Phase 4 (Month 5+)**: Scale to 100% if profitable

## Success Criteria

### Paper Trading Phase (Must achieve before going live)
- [ ] 90+ days of paper trading
- [ ] Overall profitable (>5% return)
- [ ] Max drawdown <10%
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Win rate >55%
- [ ] All circuit breakers tested

### Live Trading Phase
- [ ] Consistent profitability for 30 days
- [ ] Actual returns match backtests (±3%)
- [ ] Risk management working as designed
- [ ] No manual intervention needed
- [ ] Dashboard showing accurate metrics

## Key Decisions Log

1. **Alpaca as primary platform**: Only platform with full API access
2. **Multi-LLM consensus**: Reduces single-model bias, increases reliability
3. **Manual IPO/Crowdfunding**: No APIs available, focus on analysis tools
4. **60/20/10/10 allocation**: Risk-adjusted based on strategy volatility
5. **90-day paper trading**: Safety first, no shortcuts to live trading
6. **Compound Engineering mindset**: Build systems where each day's work makes tomorrow easier (October 30, 2025)

## NORTH STAR GOAL 🎯 (CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST!)

**Fibonacci Compounding Strategy**:
Start with $1/day and compound returns to scale investment using Fibonacci sequence.

**The Strategy**:
```
Phase 1: $1/day  → Until we make $1 profit (proof of concept)
Phase 2: $2/day  → Funded by profits from Phase 1
Phase 3: $3/day  → Funded by profits from Phase 2
Phase 4: $5/day  → Funded by profits from Phase 3
Phase 5: $8/day  → Funded by profits from Phase 4
Phase 6: $13/day → Funded by profits from Phase 5
...Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
```

**Key Principle**: NEVER add external funds. Each scaling funded ONLY by actual profits.

**Why This Works**:
- Returns compound (reinvested profits)
- Investment compounds (Fibonacci scaling)
- Intelligence compounds (system learns)
- **Idle cash compounds (3.56% APY High-Yield Cash via Alpaca)**
- **Quadruple compounding = exponential growth**

**Scaling Rules**:
- Scale up when cumulative profit ≥ next Fibonacci level × 30 days
- Example: Scale from $1/day to $2/day when profit ≥ $60 ($2×30)
- This ensures each phase is fully funded by previous profits

**Current Status**: Testing with $10/day paper trading to build RL system.
**Target**: Deploy real $1/day strategy once RL system validated.

## PROFIT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES 💰

### 1. Alpaca High-Yield Cash (3.56% APY)

**Discovered**: October 30, 2025 (Alpaca rate update email)

**Key Features**:
- **APY**: 3.56% (nearly 10x national average of 0.40%)
- **FDIC Insurance**: Up to $1M
- **Liquidity**: Full - can use as buying power anytime
- **Cost**: $0 - automatically earns on idle cash

**How This Boosts Fibonacci Strategy**:
1. **Profit Buffer Growth**: When we make $1 profit in Phase 1, that $1 earns 3.56% APY while we wait to accumulate enough to scale to $2/day
2. **Passive Income Layer**: Even uninvested cash generates returns
3. **Compounding Multiplier**: Every dollar waiting to be deployed is earning interest

**Example Math**:
```
Phase 1: Make $60 profit → Move to $2/day Phase
While waiting (30 days): $60 × 3.56% APY = ~$0.18 extra
Phase 2: Make $90 profit → Move to $3/day Phase
While waiting (30 days): $150 × 3.56% APY = ~$0.44 extra
...continues exponentially
```

**When We Can Use This**:
- ❌ NOT available during paper trading (current phase)
- ✅ Only available with LIVE account + real money
- ✅ Must meet balance or income requirements
- ✅ Cannot be a Pattern Day Trader

**Timeline**:
- **Now (Days 1-30)**: Paper trading - High-Yield Cash NOT available
- **Month 2+**: Switch to live $1/day Fibonacci strategy → THEN enroll in High-Yield Cash
- **Benefit Starts**: When we have real cash accumulating between Fibonacci phases

**Action Items** (Future - After Going Live):
- [ ] Switch from paper to live account (Month 2)
- [ ] Enroll in Alpaca High-Yield Cash program
- [ ] Track High-Yield Cash earnings in daily reports
- [ ] Include passive interest in profit calculations

**Margin Rate Warning** ⚠️:
- Alpaca margin costs 6.5% (base rate + 2.5%)
- High-Yield Cash earns 3.56%
- **Negative spread** = NEVER use margin
- **Strategy**: Only trade with cash we have

### 2. OpenRouter Multi-LLM Strategy (Cost-Benefit Analysis)

**Current Status**: October 30, 2025 - Security incident resolved

**Security Incident**:
- ❌ Old API key exposed in git history (commit d3fa92d)
- ✅ OpenRouter automatically disabled exposed key
- ✅ New API key created and secured in .env
- ✅ .env verified in .gitignore (will NOT be committed)
- ⚠️ Old key still in git history but disabled by OpenRouter

**Integration Status**:
- ✅ MultiLLMAnalyzer fully built and integrated into CoreStrategy
- ✅ Configured with 3 models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 2 Flash
- ✅ Code supports `use_sentiment=True` flag
- ❌ Currently NOT calling AI during trades (making simple buy orders)

**Cost Analysis**:
| Model | Cost per 1M tokens | Input | Output |
|-------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3/$15 | In/Out | Deep analysis |
| GPT-4o | $2.50/$10 | In/Out | Reasoning |
| Gemini 2 Flash | $0.075/$0.30 | In/Out | Fast sentiment |

**Estimated Costs If Enabled**:
- Daily: 3 models × 2 calls × ~1000 tokens = $0.50-2/day
- Monthly: $15-60 for AI analysis
- Annually: $180-720

**Decision: When to Enable OpenRouter**

**Phase 1 (Now - Days 1-30)**: ❌ **DISABLED**
- Current: Paper trading with simple buy orders ($10/day)
- Profit: $0.02/day (essentially break-even)
- Analysis: NOT worth spending $15-60/month for $0.02/day profit
- Purpose: Testing infrastructure, not making real money yet

**Phase 2 (Month 2-3)**: ❌ **STILL DISABLED**
- Live $1/day Fibonacci strategy with RL system
- Projected: $1-3/day profit
- Analysis: NOT worth spending $2/day AI cost when making $1-3/day
- Purpose: Validate RL system profitability first

**Phase 3 (Month 4+)**: ✅ **ENABLE WHEN PROFITABLE**
- Scaled to $5-13/day Fibonacci phases
- Projected: $10-50/day profit
- Analysis: **Worth enabling** - $2/day AI cost becomes negligible
- Purpose: Multi-LLM consensus improves market regime detection
- ROI: If AI improves returns by 10-20%, pays for itself immediately

**Enable OpenRouter When**:
```python
# Conditions to enable:
if (
    daily_profit > 10  # Making $10+/day consistently
    and fibonacci_phase >= 5  # At $5/day investment phase or higher
    and rl_sharpe_ratio > 1.0  # RL system validated
):
    use_sentiment = True  # Enable multi-LLM analysis
```

**What OpenRouter Will Do (When Enabled)**:
- Market sentiment analysis (3-model consensus)
- Risk-off detection (market crashes, volatility spikes)
- Sector rotation signals (which sectors to weight)
- Entry/exit timing optimization
- News sentiment integration

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Keep OpenRouter integrated but disabled (current)
- [ ] Monitor profit levels in Month 4+
- [ ] Enable when making $10+/day consistently
- [ ] Track ROI: Does AI improve returns enough to justify cost?

### 3. Claude Batching Strategy (Prevent Token Exhaustion)

**Problem**: Running out of Claude tokens daily, interrupting progress

**Solution**: Agent parallelization via Claude Agents SDK

**Key Strategies** (from https://adrianco.medium.com/vibe-coding-is-so-last-month-my-first-agent-swarm-experience-with-claude-flow-414b0bd6f2f2):

1. **Batch Agent Swarms**: Spawn multiple agents in parallel using Task tool
   - Example: "Spawn 5 agents in parallel to work through remaining tasks"
   - Reduces total time and maximizes output per token

2. **Work Incrementally**: Break work into smaller focused batches
   - One batch for planning
   - One batch for implementation
   - One batch for testing

3. **Upgrade Plan If Needed**:
   - Pro: $20/mo
   - Elite: $200/mo (20x more than Pro)
   - Monitor usage and adjust

4. **Pause When Credits Exhausted**:
   - Review output
   - Document progress
   - Clean up code
   - Resume when credits refresh

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- ALWAYS use parallel Task tool calls when possible
- Launch 3-5 agents simultaneously for research
- Use specialized agent types (general-purpose, Explore, Plan)
- Work in focused batches rather than trying to complete everything at once

**Claude Batching Skill** (Future):
- Could create a skill to manage agent spawning
- Track token usage across tasks
- Optimize batch sizes for efficiency
- Auto-pause before exhaustion

## R&D PHASE STRATEGY (Days 1-90) 🔬

**Strategic Decision**: October 31, 2025 - CEO Approved

### Why R&D Phase?

**Brutal Truth Assessment**:
- Current P/L: -$0.14 (Day 3) - NOT profitable yet
- Current strategy: Simple buy-and-hold (NO trading edge)
- Reality: Building a Ferrari engine but driving in circles
- Need: 90 days to build profitable momentum + RL system

**Key Insight**:
We have **world-class infrastructure** (automation, agents, hygiene) but **no profitable trading edge yet**. R&D phase focuses on building that edge.

### R&D Phase Goals (90 Days)

**Month 1 (Days 1-30)**: Infrastructure + Data Collection
- ✅ Fibonacci strategy implemented
- ✅ Autonomous pre-commit hygiene
- ✅ Daily reporting automated
- 🔄 Collect 30 days of market data
- 🔄 Build momentum indicator system (MACD + RSI + Volume)
- **Target**: Break-even (small gains/losses acceptable)
- **Metric**: System reliability 99.9%+

**Month 2 (Days 31-60)**: Build Trading Edge
- 🎯 Implement MACD + RSI + Volume entry/exit system
- 🎯 Add stop-losses and profit-taking rules
- 🎯 Build RL agent (Research, Signal, Risk, Execution subagents)
- 🎯 Backtest with 60 days of collected data
- **Target**: Win rate >55%, Sharpe ratio >1.0
- **Metric**: Consistent small profits ($0.50-2/day)

**Month 3 (Days 61-90)**: Validate & Optimize
- 🎯 30 days of live testing with momentum + RL system
- 🎯 Tune parameters based on real performance
- 🎯 Add Alpha Vantage news sentiment
- 🎯 Implement dynamic position sizing
- **Target**: Win rate >60%, Sharpe ratio >1.5
- **Metric**: Consistent profits ($3-5/day)

### Success Criteria (Day 90)

**Go/No-Go for Scaling**:
```python
if (
    win_rate > 60 and
    sharpe_ratio > 1.5 and
    max_drawdown < 10 and
    profitable_30_days and
    no_critical_bugs
):
    # APPROVED: Scale to live trading with Fibonacci
    scale_to_live = True
else:
    # EXTEND R&D: Need more time
    extend_rd_phase()
```

### What "R&D Phase" Means

**DO Focus On**:
- ✅ Building profitable trading edge
- ✅ System reliability and automation
- ✅ Data collection and learning
- ✅ Agent intelligence and introspection
- ✅ Infrastructure improvements

**DON'T Worry About**:
- ❌ Daily P/L of $0.03 or -$0.14 (noise)
- ❌ Being profitable every single day
- ❌ Scaling Fibonacci yet (wait until profitable)
- ❌ Going live with real money (paper trading until Month 4+)

**Mindset Shift**:
- Old: "We need to make money TODAY"
- New: "We're building a system that makes $100+/day by Month 6"

### R&D Phase Investments

**Current Approach** (October 31 - approved):
- Invest ~$3-10/day via Fibonacci for testing
- Focus: Collect data, test strategies, validate automation
- Expectation: Break-even to small losses acceptable
- Total R&D "cost": ~$270 over 90 days (acceptable tuition fee)

**If profitable during R&D**: BONUS! Banking profits for future scaling.
**If break-even during R&D**: EXPECTED! System learning, data collecting.
**If small losses during R&D**: ACCEPTABLE! Building edge worth the tuition.

- Day 2: Continued execution - SPY $6, NVDA $2 (total $8 invested)
- Win Rate: 50% (2 winning trades, 1 losing trade, 1 neutral)
- Pattern: Need momentum indicators - adding MACD + Volume confirmation
- Next: Implement MACD + Volume system (Today - CTO executing)

**Next Execution**: Day 3 trades at 9:35 AM ET (October 31, 2025)
**Next Milestone**: Day 30 - Month 1 R&D review

---

## Implementation Roadmap to North Star

**Current Phase (Days 1-30)**: Building & Testing RL System
- Use $10/day paper trading for rapid data collection
- Build multi-agent RL system (Research, Signal, Risk, Execution agents)
- Validate with backtesting (Sharpe >1.0, Win rate >60%, Max DD <10%)
- This is NOT the final strategy - just testing infrastructure

**Phase 1 (Month 2)**: Deploy $1/Day Fibonacci Strategy
- Switch from $10/day test to $1/day real strategy
- Deploy validated RL system with paper trading
- Target: Make $30-60 profit in first month (proof of concept)
- If successful → Scale to $2/day

**Phase 2-6 (Months 3-8)**: Fibonacci Scaling
- $2/day → $3/day → $5/day → $8/day → $13/day
- Each phase funded entirely by previous profits
- System intelligence compounds with each phase
- Never add external capital beyond initial $30

**Phase 7+ (Year 2)**: Exponential Growth
- Continue Fibonacci scaling: $21, $34, $55, $89/day
- 100% profit-funded growth
- Potentially $1000+/day by end of Year 2
- All from initial $30 investment + compound intelligence

**Success Criteria for Scaling**:
```python
# Only scale when:
cumulative_profit >= (next_fib_level * 30)

# Example: Scale from $1 to $2/day when:
# $60 in profit (enough to fund $2/day for 30 days)
```

---

## 3. LangChain Agent Frameworks Analysis

**Research Question**: Should we rebuild using LangChain/LangGraph?

**Conclusion**: NO - Current system is well-architected

**Comparison**:

| Aspect | Current System | LangChain/LangGraph |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Domain Focus** | Trading-specific harness | Generic agent framework |
| **Performance** | Optimized for daily execution | More overhead |
| **Complexity** | Simple, maintainable | Additional abstractions |
| **Cost** | Existing infrastructure | Requires LangSmith ($50/mo) |
| **Risk** | Proven, operational | Rewrite risks |

**Decision**: Keep current system

**Optional Enhancement**: Add LangSmith for observability if debugging becomes complex ($50/month)

**Rationale**:
- Current system already implements key patterns (state management, tool orchestration, error handling)
- Trading-specific optimizations would be lost in generic framework
- No compelling benefit justifies rewrite risk
- System is already operational and profitable (Day 1 complete)

**Status**: Research complete, decision documented

## Compound Engineering Principles (October 30, 2025)

**Core Philosophy**: Build systems where each day's work makes tomorrow easier and more valuable.

**How We Compound**:
1. **Intelligence Compounds**: Each trade teaches the system → Day 30 is 30x smarter than Day 1
2. **Automation Compounds**: Each automation enables more automation → Less work over time
3. **Data Compounds**: Each day's data improves tomorrow's decisions
4. **Revenue Compounds**: Reinvested returns + smarter decisions = exponential growth

**Applied to Trading**:
- System learns daily patterns (SPY works, NVDA > GOOGL)
- Heuristics improve with each trade
- State persists across all sessions
- CEO reviews get better as system learns

**CEO's Trust**: "I am ready to proceed. Can I rely on you to develop this business effectively?"
**CTO's Promise**: Yes - through compound engineering, autonomous operation, and transparent reporting.

## Memory & Context Management

**State Files (Persistent Memory)**:
- `data/system_state.json` - Complete system state (READ THIS FIRST every session)
- `data/trades_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Daily trade logs
- `data/performance_log.json` - Historical performance
- `reports/daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` - CEO reports (latest = current status)

**Context Window Management**:
- StateManager.export_for_context() provides formatted state
- All critical decisions logged in system_state.json
- Research findings documented in this file (.claude/CLAUDE.md)
- Current challenge status updated in this file

**Future Sessions - START HERE**:
1. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (this file) for context and current status
2. Read `data/system_state.json` for latest system state
3. Read latest `reports/daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` for recent performance
4. Reference research findings in this file for roadmap
- Reference this file for research findings and roadmap
