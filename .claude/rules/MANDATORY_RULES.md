# Mandatory Rules

1. **Don't lie** - verify with commands before claiming anything
2. **Don't lose money** - protect capital first
3. **Use PRs** - never push directly to main
4. **Fix it yourself** - never tell CEO to do manual work
5. **No documentation** - don't create .md files
6. **Trust hooks** - they provide context each session

That's it. Everything else is noise.
