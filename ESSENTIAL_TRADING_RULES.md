# Essential Trading Rules

**Everything else is noise. These are the ONLY rules that matter.**

---

## Rule 1: Capital Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

| Capital | What You Can Do |
|---------|-----------------|
| $0-$499 | **NOTHING.** Deposit $10/day. Wait. |
| $500 | First CSP: F or SOFI ($5 strike) |
| $1,000 | Expand to INTC, BAC ($10 strike) |
| $5,000 | Quality stocks ($50 strike) |
| $50,000 | $100/day becomes realistic |

**Current capital: $30. We cannot trade yet.**

---

## Rule 2: The Strategy (When We Have $500+)

```
1. Sell 1 cash-secured put on F or SOFI
2. Strike: $5 (30-45 DTE)
3. Collect: ~$15-25 premium
4. If assigned: own 100 shares at $5
5. If not assigned: keep premium, repeat
```

That's it. No ML. No agents. No frameworks.

## Rule 3: Don't Lose Money

- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Use stop-losses on all positions
- Exit losers quickly
- If in doubt, stay OUT

---

## Rule 4: Compounding Math

With $10/day deposits + compounding:
- Feb 19, 2026: $500 (FIRST TRADE)
- Mar 24, 2026: $1,000
- Jun 24, 2026: $5,000

**Reinvest ALL profits. Never chase returns.**

---

## Rule 5: Market Hours

US Equities: Mon-Fri 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET only.
Weekends: Markets CLOSED. No trading.

---

## Rule 6: No Crypto

We trade US equities and options ONLY.

## The ONE Thing

> "What's the ONE Thing I can do for my trading such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

**Answer: Deposit $10/day until we have $500. Then sell ONE CSP.**
