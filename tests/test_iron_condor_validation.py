Tests for iron condor position validation.

Created: Jan 21, 2026 (LL-268 Prevention Item #1)
Purpose: Ensure iron condors have BOTH put AND call spreads - no partial executions.

CRITICAL: This test exists because on Jan 19, 2026 we had iron condors with only
PUT legs filled (no CALL legs), creating directional exposure that violates
CLAUDE.md's iron condor mandate.
