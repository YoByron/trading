CRITICAL BUG FIX TODAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE FOUND: Crypto manage_positions() was NEVER CALLED

The crypto strategy had a well-implemented exit logic (stop-loss at -7%,
take-profit at +10%) but it was never executed because manage_positions()
was not called in the execute() flow.

IMPACT:
- Positions would NEVER close automatically
- Stop-losses never triggered
- Take-profits never triggered
- Win rate stayed at 0% (no closed trades to count)

FIX APPLIED: Added manage_positions() call at start of every execution.
COMMIT: 5ede6e4a - Pushed to branch

WHY 0% LIVE WIN RATE VS 62% BACKTEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LIVE: Win rate = 0% because NO trades have ever CLOSED
   - Positions entered but never exited
   - Can't calculate win rate without completed trades

2. BACKTEST: Win rate = 62% because it simulated hypothetical closes
   - Assumes instant market order fills
   - Calculates "if we had closed at these prices"

3. ADDITIONAL FACTORS:
   - Live uses limit orders (0.1% buffer) vs backtest assumes market orders
   - Limit orders may get worse fills or miss entirely
   - Slippage not fully modeled in backtest

CURRENT CRYPTO POSITIONS (NEED 10% GAIN TO EXIT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BTC Entry 1: $89,150.54 (Dec 7) - Current: ~$89,500-91,400 (+0.4% to +2.5%)
BTC Entry 2: $90,490.59 (Dec 7) - Current: ~$89,500-91,400 (-1% to +1%)

Need BTC to reach ~$98,000+ for take-profit trigger (10% gain from entry).
Stop-loss would trigger if BTC drops to ~$82,910 (-7% from entry).

MENTAL TOUGHNESS FRAMEWORK ADDITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added interventions from 4 new books to coaching system:
- Steve Siebold's "177 Mental Toughness Secrets" (14 principles)
- Arbinger Institute's "Leadership and Self-Deception" (6 interventions)
- Brian Tracy's "Focal Point" (6 interventions)
- Tony Robbins' "Money Master" + "Unshakeable" (7 interventions)

Total coaching interventions now: 46

NOTE: CEO correctly called out that this research wasn't directly helping
trading. Pivoted to fixing actual bugs instead.

NEXT ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. [DONE] Fixed crypto exit signal bug
2. [DONE] Committed and pushed fix
3. [PENDING] Monitor next crypto execution to verify exits work
4. [PENDING] If BTC hits 10%+ profit, system should auto-close

AUTOMATION STATUS

Last Execution: 2025-11-11T21:11:00
Next Scheduled: Monday 9:35 AM ET (markets closed today)
