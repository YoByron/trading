# Essential Trading Rules

We deleted 164 lesson files because they were noise - documenting failures instead of making money.

**The only rules that matter are in [ESSENTIAL_TRADING_RULES.md](https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/trading/blob/main/ESSENTIAL_TRADING_RULES.md)**

## Quick Summary

1. **Need $500 minimum** to start trading CSPs
2. **Strategy**: Sell cash-secured puts on F/SOFI at $5 strike
3. **Don't lose money** - protect capital first
4. **Compound everything** - reinvest all profits
5. **Keep it simple** - no ML, no agents, no complexity

## Current Status

- Capital: $30
- Trades: 0
- Action: Deposit $10/day until $500
