/* THE STORY */
We're on a 90-day journey to build an AI trading system that:
- Makes $100/day after-tax profit
- Never loses money (Phil Town Rule #1)
- Learns from every mistake
- Documents everything publicly
- Uses autonomous CTO mode 24/7

Started: October 2025
Current Capital: ~$5,000 (paper trading)
Lessons Learned: 122+
Blog Posts: 17+
Strategy: Iron Condors on SPY

/* WHY THIS EXISTS */
Most trading systems fail in silence.
We fail in public, document everything, and share our learnings.
If we can help one person avoid our mistakes, this was worth it.

/* THE AI */
Our CTO is an AI named "Ralph" (after Ralph Wiggum's unexpected insights).
Ralph runs 24/7 via GitHub Actions, finding bugs, fixing code, and
publishing blog posts about discoveries - all autonomously.
