## The Problem: Fixed vs. Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems

### What We Currently Have (STATIC/FIXED)

Our multi-agent trading system uses **predetermined, static coordination**:

```python
# Current Architecture (elite_orchestrator.py)
class EliteOrchestrator:
    def create_trade_plan(self, symbols):
        # FIXED planning phases - always the same sequence
        plan.phases = {
            PlanningPhase.INITIALIZE.value: {...},
            PlanningPhase.DATA_COLLECTION.value: {...},
            PlanningPhase.ANALYSIS.value: {...},
            PlanningPhase.RISK_ASSESSMENT.value: {...},
            PlanningPhase.EXECUTION.value: {...},
            PlanningPhase.AUDIT.value: {...}
        }
        
    def execute_plan(self, plan):
        # FIXED execution order
        # Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6
```

**Characteristics of Fixed Systems:**
- ❌ Agents have predetermined roles (Research, Signal, Risk, Execution)
- ❌ Communication paths are hardcoded (MCP → Langchain → Gemini)
- ❌ Workflow is always the same regardless of task complexity
- ❌ Cannot adapt to new types of trading problems
- ❌ Sub-optimal for tasks that don't fit the predefined structure

**Current Agent Structure (Hi-DARTS Hierarchy):**
```
MetaAgent (Coordinator)
├── ResearchAgent (FIXED ROLE: Fundamentals + News)
├── SignalAgent (FIXED ROLE: Technical Analysis)
├── RiskAgent (FIXED ROLE: Position Sizing)
└── ExecutionAgent (FIXED ROLE: Order Execution)
```

## What the Tweet is Describing (DYNAMIC/ADAPTIVE)

**Tweet Quote:**
> "Multi-agent systems often underdeliver. The problem isn't how the agents themselves are built. It's how they're organized. They are mostly built with fixed chains, trees, and graphs that can't adapt as tasks evolve. But what if the system could..."

This describes **dynamic agent graphs** where:

### Adaptive Agent Graphs

**Key Concept**: The system **restructures itself** based on the task at hand.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Dynamic Agent Spawning**: Create new specialist agents on-demand
- ✅ **Adaptive Topology**: Agent connections change based on task requirements
- ✅ **Self-Organizing Coordination**: Agents negotiate who handles what
- ✅ **Task-Driven Structure**: Different tasks get different agent graphs
- ✅ **Meta-Learning Coordination**: System learns optimal agent structures over time

**Example: Dynamic Agent Graph**
```
Simple Market Condition:
Coordinator → Analyst → Executor
(3 agents, direct chain)

Complex Volatility Event:
                 ┌─ Sentiment Agent
                 │
Coordinator ─┬─ Research Agent ─┬─ Risk Agent ─┬─ Executor
             │                   │              │
             ├─ Options Agent ──┘              │
             │                                  │
             └─ Hedge Agent ───────────────────┘
(7 agents, dynamic graph structure)
```

## Implementation Gap Analysis

### What We're Missing

| Feature | Current Status | Required For Adaptive System |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Dynamic Agent Spawning** | ❌ Fixed agents | ✅ Create specialist agents on-demand |
| **Adaptive Graph Topology** | ❌ Fixed hierarchy | ✅ Restructure based on task |
| **Task Complexity Detection** | ❌ None | ✅ Determine required agent structure |
| **Agent Role Negotiation** | ❌ Predetermined | ✅ Agents bid for tasks |
| **Meta-Learning Coordination** | ⚠️ Partial (Agent0) | ✅ Learn optimal structures |
| **Conditional Workflows** | ❌ Linear phases | ✅ Branch/loop based on results |
| **Dynamic Communication Patterns** | ❌ Fixed protocols | ✅ Agents establish channels as needed |

### What We Have That's Close

**Agent0 Co-Evolution Engine** (`src/agent_framework/agent0_coevolution_engine.py`):
- ✅ Has **curriculum learning** (tasks get harder)
- ✅ Has **executor evolution** (agents improve)
- ⚠️ BUT: Still uses fixed agent structure

**Example from our code:**
```python
# We have co-evolution, but agents are still fixed
class CoEvolutionEngine:
    def run_evolution_cycle(self):
        # Step 1: Curriculum Agent generates task (FIXED AGENT)
        task = self.curriculum_agent.generate_task(...)
        
        # Step 2: Executor Agent solves task (FIXED AGENT)
        result = self.executor_agent.execute_task(task)
        
        # MISSING: Dynamic agent graph that adapts structure
```

## Proposed Solution: Implement Dynamic Agent Graphs

### Phase 1: Add Task Complexity Analyzer

```python
class TaskComplexityAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes trading tasks and determines required agent structure"""
    
    def analyze(self, task: TradingTask) -> AgentGraphSpec:
        """
        Determine optimal agent graph for task
        
        Returns:
            AgentGraphSpec defining which agents to use and how to connect them
        """
        complexity_score = self._assess_complexity(task)
        
        if complexity_score < 0.3:
            # Simple task: Direct chain
            return AgentGraphSpec(
                agents=["Coordinator", "Analyst", "Executor"],
                connections=[("Coordinator", "Analyst"), ("Analyst", "Executor")]
            )
        elif complexity_score < 0.7:
            # Medium task: Add specialists
            return AgentGraphSpec(
                agents=["Coordinator", "Research", "Signal", "Risk", "Executor"],
                connections=[
                    ("Coordinator", "Research"),
                    ("Coordinator", "Signal"),
                    ("Research", "Risk"),
                    ("Signal", "Risk"),
                    ("Risk", "Executor")
                ]
            )
        else:
            # Complex task: Full multi-agent graph with hedging
            return AgentGraphSpec(
                agents=["Coordinator", "Research", "Signal", "Risk", 
                       "Options", "Hedge", "Sentiment", "Executor"],
                connections=[...] # Complex graph
            )
```

### Phase 2: Implement Dynamic Agent Factory

```python
class DynamicAgentFactory:
    """Creates agents on-demand based on task requirements"""
    
    def create_agent(self, agent_type: str, context: dict) -> Agent:
        """Spawn a new agent with task-specific configuration"""
        if agent_type == "OptionsSpecialist":
            return OptionsAgent(
                model=self._select_model(context),
                tools=self._get_tools(agent_type),
                context=context
            )
        # ... other agent types
```

### Phase 3: Add Agent Graph Executor

```python
class DynamicGraphExecutor:
    """Executes tasks using adaptive agent graphs"""
    
    def execute(self, task: TradingTask) -> dict:
        # 1. Analyze task complexity
        graph_spec = self.complexity_analyzer.analyze(task)
        
        # 2. Spawn required agents
        agents = {
            name: self.agent_factory.create_agent(name, task.context)
            for name in graph_spec.agents
        }
        
        # 3. Execute graph (with dynamic routing)
        results = self._execute_graph(agents, graph_spec.connections, task)
        
        # 4. Clean up agents
        self._teardown_agents(agents)
        
        return results
    
    def _execute_graph(self, agents, connections, task):
        """Execute agent graph with conditional routing"""
        # Can branch, loop, or skip based on intermediate results
        # Example: If research confidence < 0.5, spawn sentiment agent
```

- ✅ **Capability**: Complex tasks get more specialized agents
- ✅ **Adaptability**: System evolves with market conditions
- ✅ **Robustness**: Can handle unforeseen scenarios by creating new agent structures

**Cost Optimization:**
