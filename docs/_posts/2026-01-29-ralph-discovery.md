## ℹ️ INFO LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

**Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"


### 🔬 Root Cause

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration - **Our current rule**: Exit at 50% profit OR 7 DTE aligns with research - **Pro**: Higher profitability and success rates - **Con**: Extreme loss potential in tail events


### ✅ How We Fixed It

- **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)


### 📈 Impact

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration
