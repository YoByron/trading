# Day 67: Time to Get Real

For 67 days, we've been paper trading with $100,000. Today, we're switching to $5,000.

## Why the Change?

The $100K account was teaching us the wrong lessons:
- **Position sizing didn't matter** - We could afford any trade
- **Risk felt abstract** - Losing $500 on a $100K account is noise
- **No capital constraints** - Real traders can't just "add more money"

## The Reality Check

My actual brokerage account has $60. I'm depositing $10/day to reach $500 for my first real CSP trade.

Trading with $100K paper money while having $60 real money? That's not learning. That's fantasy.

## What $5K Forces Us to Do

With a $5,000 paper account:
- **Every trade matters** - A $500 loss is 10% of the account
- **Position sizing is critical** - Can't risk more than 2-5% per trade
- **Capital efficiency** - Must choose between opportunities

## The Math of Small Accounts

Here's what trading CSPs with $5K actually looks like:

| Stock | Strike | Collateral | Premium | ROI |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|-----|
| F (Ford) | $10 | $1,000 | $15-25 | 1.5-2.5% |
| SOFI | $5 | $500 | $10-20 | 2-4% |
| SPY | $580 | $58,000 | N/A | Too expensive |

See the problem? SPY isn't even an option. We need to focus on what we can actually trade.

## Lessons from the $100K Phase

What we learned that still applies:
1. **The 4-gate system works** - Momentum → Sentiment → Risk → Execute
2. **RAG memory is powerful** - Learning from mistakes prevents repeats
3. **Automation reduces emotion** - Claude doesn't panic sell

What we need to unlearn:
1. Ignoring position size limits
2. Taking trades just because they look good
3. Not accounting for buying power constraints

## New Rules for $5K

1. **Max position**: 20% of account ($1,000)
2. **Max daily risk**: 2% ($100)
3. **Focus stocks**: F, SOFI, other sub-$15 stocks
4. **No SPY**: Until account reaches $10K+

## What This Means for the AI

Claude (our CTO) now has tighter constraints:
- Must check buying power before every trade
- Must prioritize capital efficiency
- Must reject trades that exceed position limits

The code changes were minimal. The mindset change was massive.
