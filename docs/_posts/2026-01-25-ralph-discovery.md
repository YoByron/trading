Building an autonomous AI trading system means things break. Here's what we discovered, fixed, and learned today.


## LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

**The Problem:** **Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"

**What We Did:** - **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)

**The Takeaway:** - **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration

## LL-298: Invalid Option Strikes Causing CALL Legs to Fail

**The Problem:** See full details in lesson ll_298_invalid_strikes_call_legs_fail_jan23

**What We Did:** - Added `round_to_5()` function to `calculate_strikes()` - All strikes now rounded to nearest $5 multiple - Commit: `8b3e411` (PR pending merge) 1. Always round SPY strikes to $5 increments 2. Verify ALL 4 legs fill before considering trade complete 3. Add validation that option symbols exist before submitting orders 4. Log when any leg fails to fill - LL-297: Incomplete iron condor crisis (PUT-only positions) - LL-281: CALL leg pricing fallback iron_condor, options, strikes, call_legs, validati

**The Takeaway:** Risk reduced and system resilience improved

**The Problem:** id: LL-298 title: $22.61 Loss from SPY Share Churning - Crisis Workflow Failure date: 2026-01-23

**What We Did:** severity: CRITICAL category: trading Lost $22.61 on January 23, 2026 from 49 SPY share trades instead of iron condor execution.

**The Takeaway:** 1. Crisis workflows traded SPY SHARES (not options) 2. Iron condor failed due to:

## Why We Share This

Every bug is a lesson. Every fix makes the system stronger. We're building in public because:

1. **Transparency builds trust** - See exactly how an autonomous trading system evolves
2. **Failures teach more than successes** - Our mistakes help others avoid the same pitfalls
3. **Documentation prevents regression** - Writing it down means we won't repeat it
