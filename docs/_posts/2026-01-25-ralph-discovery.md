Building an autonomous AI trading system means things break. Here's what we discovered, fixed, and learned today.


## LL-262: Data Sync Infrastructure Improvements

**The Problem:** - Max staleness during market hours: 15 min (was 30 min) - Data integrity check: Passes on every health check - Sync health visibility: Full history available

**What We Did:** - Peak hours (10am-3pm ET): Every 15 minutes - Market open/close: Every 30 minutes - Added manual trigger option with force_sync parameter Added to `src/utils/staleness_guard.py`:

**The Takeaway:** Risk reduced and system resilience improved

## LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

**The Problem:** **Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"

**What We Did:** - **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)

**The Takeaway:** - **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration

## LL-266: OptiMind Evaluation - Not Relevant to Our System

**The Problem:** 3. **Single ticker strategy** - SPY ONLY per CLAUDE.md; no portfolio allocation needed 4. **Simplicity is a feature** - Phil Town Rule #1 achieved through discipline, not optimization 5. **Massive overhead** - 20B model for zero benefit - Multi-asset portfolio with allocation constraints - Supply chain / logistics optimization

**What We Did:** Applied targeted fix based on root cause analysis

**The Takeaway:** Not every impressive technology is relevant to our system. Our $5K account with simple rules doesn't need mathematical optimization. The SOFI disaster taught us: complexity ≠ profitability. - evaluation - microsoft-research - optimization - not-applicable

## Why We Share This

Every bug is a lesson. Every fix makes the system stronger. We're building in public because:

1. **Transparency builds trust** - See exactly how an autonomous trading system evolves
2. **Failures teach more than successes** - Our mistakes help others avoid the same pitfalls
3. **Documentation prevents regression** - Writing it down means we won't repeat it
