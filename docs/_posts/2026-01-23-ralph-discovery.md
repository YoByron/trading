## 🤖 Autonomous Engineering in Action

Our AI system, Ralph (named after the [Ralph Wiggum iterative coding technique](https://github.com/Th0rgal/opencode-ralph-wiggum)),
continuously monitors, discovers, and fixes issues in our trading system. Here's what it found today.


### Discovery #1: LL-282: Crisis Mode Failure Analysis - Jan 22, 2026

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
- CEO lost trust in the system The trade gateway checked individual trade risk (5% max) but NOT cumulative exposure. - Trade 1: $248 risk (5% of $4,986) - APPROVED - Trade 2: $248 risk (5% of $4,986) - APPROVED - Trade 3: $248 risk (5% of $4,986) - APPROVED - ...continued until 8 contracts ($1,984 risk = 40% exposure)

**🔧 The Fix:**
1. **Circuit Breaker in Trade Gateway** (trade_gateway.py:578-630) - Hard stop before any position-opening trade - Checks TRADING_HALTED flag file - Blocks when unrealized loss > 25% of equity - Blocks when option positions > 4 2. **TRADING_HALTED Flag** (data/TRADING_HALTED) - Manual halt mechanism - Must be explicitly removed to resume trading 3. **Scheduled Position Close** (.github/workflows/scheduled-position-close.yml) - Runs Jan 23, 9:45 AM ET - Attempts close_position() then market order

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #2: LL-281: CALL Leg Pricing Fix - Aggressive Fallbacks

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
1. **Detect CALL vs PUT**: Check symbol for "C" to identify calls 2. **Higher CALL fallback**: $4.00 for CALLs vs $2.00 for PUTs 3. **Price buffer**: Add 10% buffer on BUY orders to ensure fills 4. **Quote validation**: Check for $0 bids/asks before using ```python fallback = 1.50 if is_call: fallback = 4.00  # CALLs are more expensive else: fallback = 2.00  # PUTs ``` 1. **Use realistic fallbacks**: Match typical option prices for each type 2. **Add price buffers**: Ensure aggressive enough for

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #3: LL-281: Position Accumulation Crisis - 8 Contracts Instead of Max 4

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
- LL-220: Credit spread win rates - LL-246: Position count enforcement - LL-268: Exit timing research

**🔧 The Fix:**
Automated fix applied by Ralph

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Self-healing systems aren't just about fixing bugs—they're about building confidence
in autonomous operations. Every fix Ralph makes is:

1. **Documented** in our lessons learned database
2. **Tested** before being applied
3. **Reviewed** via pull request (when significant)

This is the future of software engineering: systems that improve themselves.
