## 🤖 Autonomous Engineering in Action

Our AI system, Ralph (named after the [Ralph Wiggum iterative coding technique](https://github.com/Th0rgal/opencode-ralph-wiggum)),
continuously monitors, discovers, and fixes issues in our trading system. Here's what it found today.


### Discovery #1: LL-298: Invalid Option Strikes Causing CALL Legs to Fail

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
- Added `round_to_5()` function to `calculate_strikes()` - All strikes now rounded to nearest $5 multiple - Commit: `8b3e411` (PR pending merge) 1. Always round SPY strikes to $5 increments 2. Verify ALL 4 legs fill before considering trade complete 3. Add validation that option symbols exist before submitting orders 4. Log when any leg fails to fill - LL-297: Incomplete iron condor crisis (PUT-only positions) - LL-281: CALL leg pricing fallback iron_condor, options, strikes, call_legs, validati

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #2: LL-282: Crisis Mode Failure Analysis - Jan 22, 2026

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
- CEO lost trust in the system The trade gateway checked individual trade risk (5% max) but NOT cumulative exposure. - Trade 1: $248 risk (5% of $4,986) - APPROVED - Trade 2: $248 risk (5% of $4,986) - APPROVED - Trade 3: $248 risk (5% of $4,986) - APPROVED - ...continued until 8 contracts ($1,984 risk = 40% exposure)

**🔧 The Fix:**
1. **Circuit Breaker in Trade Gateway** (trade_gateway.py:578-630) - Hard stop before any position-opening trade - Checks TRADING_HALTED flag file - Blocks when unrealized loss > 25% of equity - Blocks when option positions > 4 2. **TRADING_HALTED Flag** (data/TRADING_HALTED) - Manual halt mechanism - Must be explicitly removed to resume trading 3. **Scheduled Position Close** (.github/workflows/scheduled-position-close.yml) - Runs Jan 23, 9:45 AM ET - Attempts close_position() then market order

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #3: LL-262: Data Sync Infrastructure Improvements

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
- Max staleness during market hours: 15 min (was 30 min) - Data integrity check: Passes on every health check - Sync health visibility: Full history available

**🔧 The Fix:**
- Peak hours (10am-3pm ET): Every 15 minutes - Market open/close: Every 30 minutes - Added manual trigger option with force_sync parameter Added to `src/utils/staleness_guard.py`:

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Self-healing systems aren't just about fixing bugs—they're about building confidence
in autonomous operations. Every fix Ralph makes is:

1. **Documented** in our lessons learned database
2. **Tested** before being applied
3. **Reviewed** via pull request (when significant)

This is the future of software engineering: systems that improve themselves.
