## Why We Share This

Every bug is a lesson. Every fix makes the system stronger. We're building in public because:

1. **Transparency builds trust** - See exactly how an autonomous trading system evolves
2. **Failures teach more than successes** - Our mistakes help others avoid the same pitfalls
3. **Documentation prevents regression** - Writing it down means we won't repeat it
