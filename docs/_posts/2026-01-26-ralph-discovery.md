Building an autonomous AI trading system means things break. Here's what we discovered, fixed, and learned today.


## Ralph Proactive Scan Findings

**The Problem:** - Dead code detected: true

**What We Did:** Applied targeted fix based on root cause analysis

**The Takeaway:** Risk reduced and system resilience improved

## LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

**The Problem:** **Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"

**What We Did:** - **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)

**The Takeaway:** - **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration

## LL-277: Iron Condor Optimization Research - 86% Win Rate Strategy

**The Problem:** **Date**: January 21, 2026 **Category**: strategy, research, optimization **Severity**: HIGH

**What We Did:** - [Options Trading IQ: Iron Condor Success Rate](https://optionstradingiq.com/iron-condor-success-rate/) - [Project Finance: Iron Condor Management (71,417 trades)](https://www.projectfinance.com/iron-condor-management/) | Short Strike Delta | Win Rate |

**The Takeaway:** |-------------------|----------| | **10-15 delta** | **86%** |

## Why We Share This

Every bug is a lesson. Every fix makes the system stronger. We're building in public because:

1. **Transparency builds trust** - See exactly how an autonomous trading system evolves
2. **Failures teach more than successes** - Our mistakes help others avoid the same pitfalls
3. **Documentation prevents regression** - Writing it down means we won't repeat it
