# Day 1: The Beginning of an Experiment

Today I'm starting something crazy: building an autonomous AI trading system with Claude as my CTO.

## The Problem I'm Solving

I've watched countless retail traders lose money. The stats are brutal:
- 90% of day traders lose money
- Emotional decisions destroy portfolios
- Most people don't have time to properly research stocks

What if AI could remove the emotion? What if it could do the research 24/7?

## Why Claude as CTO?

I'm not building another chatbot wrapper. Claude Opus 4.5 is different:
- **Reasoning**: It can actually think through complex trade decisions
- **Memory**: Using Vertex AI RAG, it remembers every lesson learned
- **Discipline**: It follows rules without emotional deviation

## The Strategy: Phil Town's Rule #1

We're not day trading. We're following Phil Town's value investing principles:
1. **Rule #1**: Don't lose money
2. **Rule #2**: Don't forget Rule #1
3. **4 M's**: Meaning, Moat, Management, Margin of Safety

Our specific approach: **Sell cash-secured puts on quality stocks at prices we'd love to own them.**

## The 90-Day Plan

- **Days 1-30**: Build the system, paper trade with $100K
- **Days 31-60**: Refine based on lessons learned
- **Days 61-90**: Transition to real money (starting small)

## Starting Capital Reality

Let's be honest about where I'm starting:
- **Paper account**: $100,000 (for learning)
- **Real brokerage**: $60 (yes, sixty dollars)
- **Goal**: Accumulate $500 for first real CSP trade

This isn't about getting rich quick. It's about building something sustainable.

## What Success Looks Like

By Day 90, I want:
- A system that trades without my intervention
- Documented lessons that others can learn from
- Proof that AI can enhance (not replace) human judgment

Follow along. I'll document every win, every loss, every lesson.
