# Day 50/90: Options Strategy Continues to Outperform

**Portfolio Value:** $100,942.23
**Total P/L:** +$942.23 (+0.94%)
**Daily Change:** +0.00%

## Biggest Winners Today

Our options positions continue to be the primary profit driver:

| Position | P/L | Strategy |
|----------|-----|----------|
| SPY 660 Put | **+$460.00** | Short put (theta decay) |
| AMD 200 Put | **+$322.00** | Short put (theta decay) |
| SPY Shares | +$113.95 | Core equity holding |
| INTC 35 Puts | +$105.00 | Short puts (2 contracts) |
| SOFI 24 Put | +$45.00 | Short put (theta decay) |

**Total Options P/L: +$932.00** (99% of profits)

## Success Factors

### 1. Phil Town Style Concentration
We're not over-diversifying. Our options are concentrated in high-quality underlyings:
- SPY (market index)
- AMD (semiconductor leader)
- INTC (value play)
- SOFI (fintech growth)

### 2. Theta Decay Working For Us
As put sellers, time is on our side. Every day that passes without the underlying dropping below our strike, we pocket premium. This is the core of our options strategy.

### 3. Strike Selection Discipline
- SPY 660 put: ~5% out of the money
- AMD 200 put: Deep OTM (safe margin)
- INTC 35 puts: At support level

### 4. Position Sizing
Each position is sized appropriately - no single position can blow up the account.

## What's NOT Working

### 1. Daily Execution Automation
Today's automated trading workflow failed due to secrets validation issues. We had to manually verify positions. **Action:** Fix GitHub Actions secrets configuration.

### 2. Data Freshness
System state was stale until manual screenshot audit. **Action:** Implement more robust auto-sync.

## Key Metrics

- **Win Rate:** 50% (live trades)
- **Options Win Rate:** 75%+ (our edge)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Needs improvement
- **Max Drawdown:** -$983.72 (Dec 17)

## Tomorrow's Plan (Dec 31 - Half Day)

1. Monitor existing positions (no new trades on half day)
2. Review theta decay on current options
3. Prepare for January expiration cycle

## Lessons Learned

1. **Options > Equities** for this strategy - 99% of profits from options
2. **Theta is king** - Time decay is our friend as sellers
3. **Concentration works** - Phil Town was right
4. **Automation needs hardening** - Manual intervention shouldn't be required
