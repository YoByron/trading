## 🟠 HIGH LL-298: Invalid Option Strikes Causing CALL Legs to Fail

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

- Dead code detected: true


### 🔬 Root Cause

```python


### ✅ How We Fixed It

- Added `round_to_5()` function to `calculate_strikes()` - All strikes now rounded to nearest $5 multiple - Commit: `8b3e411` (PR pending merge) 1. Always round SPY strikes to $5 increments 2. Verify ALL 4 legs fill before considering trade complete 3. Add validation that option symbols exist before submitting orders 4. Log when any leg fails to fill - LL-297: Incomplete iron condor crisis (PUT-only positions) - LL-281: CALL leg pricing fallback iron_condor, options, strikes, call_legs, validati


### 💻 The Fix

```python
# BROKEN CODE (before fix)
short_call = round(price * 1.05)  # round(690*1.05) = $724 INVALID!

# FIXED CODE
def round_to_5(x): return round(x / 5) * 5
short_call = round_to_5(price * 1.05)  # round_to_5(724.5) = $725 VALID!
```


### 📈 Impact

Risk reduced and system resilience improved.

id: LL-298 title: $22.61 Loss from SPY Share Churning - Crisis Workflow Failure date: 2026-01-23


### ✅ How We Fixed It

severity: CRITICAL category: trading Lost $22.61 on January 23, 2026 from 49 SPY share trades instead of iron condor execution.


### 📈 Impact

1. Crisis workflows traded SPY SHARES (not options) 2. Iron condor failed due to:

## ℹ️ INFO LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

**Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"


### 🔬 Root Cause

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration - **Our current rule**: Exit at 50% profit OR 7 DTE aligns with research - **Pro**: Higher profitability and success rates - **Con**: Extreme loss potential in tail events


### ✅ How We Fixed It

- **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)


### 📈 Impact

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration
