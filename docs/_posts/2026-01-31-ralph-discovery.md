## ℹ️ INFO LL-318: Claude Code Async Hooks for Performance

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

Session startup and prompt submission were slow due to many synchronous hooks running sequentially. Each hook blocked Claude's execution until completion.


### ✅ How We Fixed It

Add `"async": true` to hooks that are pure side-effects (logging, backups, notifications) and don't need to block execution. ```json { "type": "command", "command": "./my-hook.sh", "async": true, "timeout": 30 } ``` **YES - Make Async:** - Backup scripts (backup_critical_state.sh) - Feedback capture (capture_feedback.sh) - Blog generators (auto_blog_generator.sh) - Session learning capture (capture_session_learnings.sh) - Any pure logging/notification hook **NO - Keep Synchronous:** - Hooks that


### 💻 The Fix

```python
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "./my-hook.sh",
  "async": true,
  "timeout": 30
}
```


### 📈 Impact

Reduced startup latency by ~15-20 seconds by making 5 hooks async. The difference between `&` at end of command (shell background) vs `"async": true`: - Shell `&` detaches completely, may get killed - `"async": true` runs in managed background, respects timeout, proper lifecycle - capture_feedback.s
