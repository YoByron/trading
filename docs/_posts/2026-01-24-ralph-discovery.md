### Discovery #2: LL-298: Invalid Option Strikes Causing CALL Legs to Fail

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
- Added `round_to_5()` function to `calculate_strikes()` - All strikes now rounded to nearest $5 multiple - Commit: `8b3e411` (PR pending merge) 1. Always round SPY strikes to $5 increments 2. Verify ALL 4 legs fill before considering trade complete 3. Add validation that option symbols exist before submitting orders 4. Log when any leg fails to fill - LL-297: Incomplete iron condor crisis (PUT-only positions) - LL-281: CALL leg pricing fallback iron_condor, options, strikes, call_legs, validati

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Self-healing systems aren't just about fixing bugs—they're about building confidence
in autonomous operations. Every fix Ralph makes is:

1. **Documented** in our lessons learned database
2. **Tested** before being applied
3. **Reviewed** via pull request (when significant)

This is the future of software engineering: systems that improve themselves.
