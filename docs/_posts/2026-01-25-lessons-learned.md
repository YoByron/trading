# Day 89 of 90 | Sunday, January 25, 2026

**1 days remaining** in our journey to build a profitable AI trading system.

Every mistake is a lesson in disguise. Today we uncovered a critical flaw in our system - the kind that separates amateur traders from professionals who survive long-term.

## The Hard Lessons

*These are the moments that test us. Critical issues that demanded immediate attention.*

### CTO Ignores Surfaced RAG Lessons - Pattern Identified

Every session:


## Important Discoveries

*Not emergencies, but insights that will shape how we trade going forward.*

### RAG Learning Synthesis - Iron Condor Adjustments

During Ralph Mode iteration 21, queried RAG and synthesized key learnings from recent lessons.

## Tech Stack Behind the Lessons

Every lesson we learn is captured, analyzed, and stored by our AI infrastructure:

        ERROR["Error/Insight<br/>Detected"] --> CLAUDE["Claude Opus<br/>(Analysis)"]
        CLAUDE --> RAG["Vertex AI RAG<br/>(Storage)"]
        RAG --> BLOG["GitHub Pages<br/>(Publishing)"]
        BLOG --> DEVTO["Dev.to<br/>(Distribution)"]
    end
</div>

### How We Learn Autonomously

| Component | Role in Learning |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Claude Opus 4.5** | Analyzes errors, extracts insights, determines severity |
| **Vertex AI RAG** | Stores lessons with 768D embeddings for semantic search |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash** | Retrieves relevant past lessons before new trades |
| **OpenRouter (DeepSeek)** | Cost-effective sentiment analysis and research |

### Why This Matters

1. **No Lesson Lost**: Every insight persists in our RAG corpus
2. **Contextual Recall**: Before each trade, we query similar past situations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: 200+ lessons shape every decision
4. **Transparent Journey**: All learnings published publicly

## The Journey So Far

We're building an autonomous AI trading system that learns from every mistake. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about building a system that can consistently generate income through disciplined options trading.

**Our approach:**
- Paper trade for 90 days to validate the strategy
- Document every lesson, every failure, every win
- Use AI (Claude) as CTO to automate and improve
- Follow Phil Town's Rule #1: Don't lose money
