## 🟠 HIGH LL-298: Invalid Option Strikes Causing CALL Legs to Fail

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

- Dead code detected: true


### 🔬 Root Cause

```python


### ✅ How We Fixed It

- Added `round_to_5()` function to `calculate_strikes()` - All strikes now rounded to nearest $5 multiple - Commit: `8b3e411` (PR pending merge) 1. Always round SPY strikes to $5 increments 2. Verify ALL 4 legs fill before considering trade complete 3. Add validation that option symbols exist before submitting orders 4. Log when any leg fails to fill - LL-297: Incomplete iron condor crisis (PUT-only positions) - LL-281: CALL leg pricing fallback iron_condor, options, strikes, call_legs, validati


### 💻 The Fix

```python
# BROKEN CODE (before fix)
short_call = round(price * 1.05)  # round(690*1.05) = $724 INVALID!

# FIXED CODE
def round_to_5(x): return round(x / 5) * 5
short_call = round_to_5(price * 1.05)  # round_to_5(724.5) = $725 VALID!
```


### 📈 Impact

Risk reduced and system resilience improved.

## ℹ️ INFO LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

**Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"


### 🔬 Root Cause

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration - **Our current rule**: Exit at 50% profit OR 7 DTE aligns with research - **Pro**: Higher profitability and success rates - **Con**: Extreme loss potential in tail events


### ✅ How We Fixed It

- **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)


### 📈 Impact

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration

## ℹ️ INFO LL-318: Claude Code Async Hooks for Performance

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

Session startup and prompt submission were slow due to many synchronous hooks running sequentially. Each hook blocked Claude's execution until completion.


### ✅ How We Fixed It

Add `"async": true` to hooks that are pure side-effects (logging, backups, notifications) and don't need to block execution. ```json { "type": "command", "command": "./my-hook.sh", "async": true, "timeout": 30 } ``` **YES - Make Async:** - Backup scripts (backup_critical_state.sh) - Feedback capture (capture_feedback.sh) - Blog generators (auto_blog_generator.sh) - Session learning capture (capture_session_learnings.sh) - Any pure logging/notification hook **NO - Keep Synchronous:** - Hooks that


### 💻 The Fix

```python
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "./my-hook.sh",
  "async": true,
  "timeout": 30
}
```


### 📈 Impact

Reduced startup latency by ~15-20 seconds by making 5 hooks async. The difference between `&` at end of command (shell background) vs `"async": true`: - Shell `&` detaches completely, may get killed - `"async": true` runs in managed background, respects timeout, proper lifecycle - capture_feedback.s
