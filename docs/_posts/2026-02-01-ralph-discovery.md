### 🚨 What Went Wrong

id: LL-298 title: $22.61 Loss from SPY Share Churning - Crisis Workflow Failure date: 2026-01-23


### ✅ How We Fixed It

severity: CRITICAL category: trading Lost $22.61 on January 23, 2026 from 49 SPY share trades instead of iron condor execution.


### 📈 Impact

1. Crisis workflows traded SPY SHARES (not options) 2. Iron condor failed due to:

## ℹ️ INFO LL-309: Iron Condor Optimal Control Research

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

**Date**: 2026-01-25 **Category**: Research / Strategy Optimization **Source**: arXiv:2501.12397 - "Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios"


### 🔬 Root Cause

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration - **Our current rule**: Exit at 50% profit OR 7 DTE aligns with research - **Pro**: Higher profitability and success rates - **Con**: Extreme loss potential in tail events


### ✅ How We Fixed It

- **Finding**: "Asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with τ = T are optimal in SPX markets" - **Meaning**: Put spread should be closer to current price than call spread - **Why**: Markets have negative skew (crashes more likely than rallies)


### 📈 Impact

- **Left-biased portfolios**: Hold to expiration (τ = T) is optimal - **Non-left-biased portfolios**: Exit at 50-75% of duration

## ℹ️ INFO LL-318: Claude Code Async Hooks for Performance

### 🚨 What Went Wrong

Session startup and prompt submission were slow due to many synchronous hooks running sequentially. Each hook blocked Claude's execution until completion.


### ✅ How We Fixed It

Add `"async": true` to hooks that are pure side-effects (logging, backups, notifications) and don't need to block execution. ```json { "type": "command", "command": "./my-hook.sh", "async": true, "timeout": 30 } ``` **YES - Make Async:** - Backup scripts (backup_critical_state.sh) - Feedback capture (capture_feedback.sh) - Blog generators (auto_blog_generator.sh) - Session learning capture (capture_session_learnings.sh) - Any pure logging/notification hook **NO - Keep Synchronous:** - Hooks that


### 💻 The Fix

```python
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "./my-hook.sh",
  "async": true,
  "timeout": 30
}
```


### 📈 Impact

Reduced startup latency by ~15-20 seconds by making 5 hooks async. The difference between `&` at end of command (shell background) vs `"async": true`: - Shell `&` detaches completely, may get killed - `"async": true` runs in managed background, respects timeout, proper lifecycle - capture_feedback.s
