# Lesson Learned #093: Comprehensive Strategy Review - Still Not Following Phil Town

**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Strategy, Compliance, Financial Math

## Session Questions Addressed

1. Are we following Phil Town Rule #1? **NO**
2. Why didn't we meet North Star today? **Capital insufficient + targets unrealistic**
3. Can we reach $100/day with $200? **Yes, by June 24, 2026 with compounding**
4. What do top 2026 traders do? **Credit spreads, CSPs, risk-defined strategies**

## Critical Findings

### Phil Town Compliance: FAILING

| Requirement | Phil Town | Our System |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Rule #1 | Don't lose money | -3.04% daily avg |
| 4Ms Framework | Required | Not implemented |
| Margin of Safety | 50% below sticker | Not calculated |
| Options Strategy | CSPs on wonderful companies | Random direction bets |

### North Star Reality Check

- Current live capital: $30
- North Star: $100/day
- Required return: 333% daily (IMPOSSIBLE)
- Realistic timeline: June 24, 2026 at $5,000 capital

### Compounding Milestones (FOLLOW THIS)

| Date | Capital | Daily Target |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Jan 29, 2026 | $200 | $5/day |
| Feb 24, 2026 | $500 | $15/day |
| Mar 24, 2026 | $1,000 | $30/day |
| Apr 29, 2026 | $2,000 | $60/day |
| Jun 24, 2026 | $5,000 | $100/day |

## Top 2026 Small Account Strategies (Research)

1. Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC) - $400+ capital
2. Credit Spreads - $100-500 capital
3. Cash-Secured Puts - Strike x 100 capital
4. Iron Condors - Defined risk

## Environment Limitations

- Docker: NOT available in sandbox
- ChromaDB: NOT installed
- Vertex AI: SSL-blocked
- Solution: CI writes to RAG, local JSON backup

## Action Items

1. Wait for $200 (Jan 29, 2026) for first trade
2. Implement 4Ms stock screener
3. Calculate sticker prices with MOS
4. Build CSP watchlist: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BRK.B, SPY
5. Update lessons count in GitHub Pages (80+ -> 90+)
