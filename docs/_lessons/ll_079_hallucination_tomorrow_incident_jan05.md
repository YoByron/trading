# Lesson Learned #079: Tomorrow Hallucination Incident (Jan 5, 2026)

**Date**: January 5, 2026
**Severity**: HIGH - Trust breach with CEO
**Category**: AI Reliability / Hallucination Prevention

## What Happened

On Monday, January 5, 2026, I said "Ready for tomorrow's trading session" when TODAY was a trading day (Monday). Markets were scheduled to open at 9:30 AM ET.

This was a hallucination - I made a time-related claim without verifying the actual date.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **No verification before claiming**: I did not run `date` before making a statement about when trading would occur
2. **Overconfidence**: I assumed I knew the day instead of checking
3. **Ignored available context**: The session hook provided today's date, but I didn't internalize it
4. **Pattern completion over accuracy**: LLMs naturally complete patterns; "dry run for trading" → "tomorrow's session" felt natural but was wrong

## Impact

- CEO lost trust in the system
- Demonstrated that AI can fail on basic facts
- Highlighted need for systematic verification protocols

## Research-Based Solution

Implemented Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) protocol based on Meta Research (2024):
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495
- Finding: CoVe reduces hallucinations by 23% (F1: 0.39 → 0.48)

### 4-Step CoVe Process

1. **DRAFT**: What do I want to say?
2. **QUESTION**: What verification would prove this?
3. **VERIFY**: Run command, capture output
4. **CLAIM**: Only state what evidence supports

## Implemented Safeguards

1. **New hook**: `.claude/hooks/enforce_verification.sh` - Reminds to verify before every response
2. **Protocol script**: `src/utils/chain_of_verification.py` - Programmatic verification tools
3. **CLAUDE.md update**: Added anti-hallucination protocol with mandatory commands
4. **FORBIDDEN actions**: Listed specific hallucination-prone statements

## Mandatory Verification Commands

| Claim Type | Required Command |
|------------|------------------|
| Date/Time | `date "+%A, %B %d, %Y - %I:%M %p %Z"` |
| Market Status | Check time vs 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET |
| File Exists | `ls -la [filepath]` |
| Task Done | Show command output as proof |
| CI Status | Query GitHub API |

## Key Learnings

1. **Never trust internal "knowledge" for time-sensitive facts** - Always verify
2. **"I don't know, let me check" is better than a wrong answer**
3. **Evidence-first communication** - Show proof, then make claim
4. **Hooks alone don't prevent hallucination** - Must actively use verification
5. **Trust is hard to earn, easy to lose** - One error can break months of good work

## Prevention Checklist

Before ANY time-related statement:
- [ ] Run `date` command
- [ ] Check day of week (Mon-Fri = trading day)
- [ ] Check time vs market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- [ ] State verified facts only
