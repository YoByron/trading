# Lesson Learned #091: $100/day North Star Impossible with $200 Capital

**ID**: LL-091
**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Severity**: CRITICAL

## The Math

- Capital: $200
- Target: $100/day
- Required Return: **50% per day**

**This is mathematically impossible.**

## Reality Check

With cash-secured puts:
- Monthly premium: 2-4% of capital
- With $200: Realistic daily income = **$0.30-$1.00**

## Capital Needed for $100/day

- Conservative: ~$150,000
- Aggressive: ~$70,000

## Scaled Targets

| Capital | Target |
|---------|--------|
| $200-$1,000 | $1-$5/day |
| $1,000-$5,000 | $5-$25/day |
| $50,000+ | $100+/day |

## Key Insight

Dollar targets must scale with capital. Focus on **percentage returns**.
