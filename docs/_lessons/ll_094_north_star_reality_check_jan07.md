# Lesson Learned #094: North Star $100/day Reality Check

**Date**: January 7, 2026
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Strategy, Capital Management, Math

## The Math Problem

**Current state:**
- Live capital: $30
- Daily target: $100
- Required return: 333% daily = **IMPOSSIBLE**

**Paper trading Jan 6:**
- P/L: +$83.34
- Target: $100
- Gap: $16.66 (missed by 16.66%)

## Phil Town Rule #1 Compliance

### What We DO Right
- Cash Secured Puts on quality stocks
- Stop-losses on positions
- Paper testing before live

### What We DON'T Do (Phil Town Requires)
- 4Ms Analysis (Meaning, Moat, Management, Margin of Safety)
- 10-10 Rule (10-year track record, 50% discount)
- We're premium-selling, not Phil Town buy-and-hold

## Realistic Path to $100/day

From `data/system_state.json` compounding milestones:

| Day | Date | Capital | Daily Target | Strategy |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 23 | Jan 29, 2026 | $200 | $5/day | First trade - Single CSP |
| 49 | Feb 24, 2026 | $500 | $15/day | 2 CSPs or Iron Condor |
| 77 | Mar 24, 2026 | $1,000 | $30/day | Wheel strategy |
| 113 | Apr 29, 2026 | $2,000 | $60/day | Multiple wheels |
| **169** | **Jun 24, 2026** | **$5,000** | **$100/day** | Full Phil Town |

## Compounding Power (Evidence)

- Deposits only: $2,637
- With 2% daily compounding: $5,089
- **Advantage: +93% more capital**

## Top Trader Strategies for Small Accounts (2026 Research)

1. **Credit Spreads** - Defined risk, can start with $100
2. **Poor Man's Covered Call** - 20-30% of covered call capital
3. **Iron Condors** - At $500+ capital
4. **50/25 Delta Rule** - Sell 50 Delta, buy 25 Delta
5. **Take profits at 50%** - We have this
6. **Cut losses at 100%** - We have 200%

## Key Lesson

**$100/day is NOT achievable with $30 capital.**

Must follow the compounding milestones. No shortcuts.
