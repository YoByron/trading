# North Star Action Plan: Path to $100/Day Net Income

**Date**: December 1, 2025  
**Current Status**: Day 9 of 90-day R&D phase  
**Current Performance**: +$13.96 total P/L, 66.7% win rate, $0.28 profit per trade  
**Target**: $100/day net income by Month 6

---

## Executive Summary

**The Math Problem**:
- Current: $0.28 profit per trade × ~3 trades/day = $0.84/day
- Target: $100/day
- **Gap**: Need 119x improvement

**The Solution**: Multi-pronged approach combining:
1. **Capital Scaling** (10-150x increase)
2. **Profit Per Trade Optimization** (2-5x improvement)
3. **Multiple Income Streams** (options, dividends, high-yield cash)
4. **Better Exit Strategies** (capture more profit per winning trade)

---

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### Gap 1: Capital Deployment Too Low ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Current State**:
- Daily investment: $10/day (paper trading)
- System state shows scaling decision (Nov 25): $1,500/day planned
- **Reality**: Still at $10/day (not implemented)

**Impact**:
- Even with 100% win rate, $10/day can't generate $100/day profit
- Need minimum $1,000-1,500/day deployment to reach target

**Action Required**:
1. ✅ Verify scaling decision was actually implemented
2. ✅ Remove $1,000/day cap in `src/core/config.py` (line 104)
3. ✅ Update GitHub Actions workflow with new `DAILY_INVESTMENT` secret
4. ✅ Test with paper trading first before live deployment
5. ✅ Implement gradual scaling (10 → 100 → 500 → 1,500 over 30 days)

**Expected Impact**: 150x increase in profit potential

---

### Gap 2: Profit Per Trade Too Low ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Current State**:
- Profit per trade: $0.28 (from backtest data)
- Win rate: 62-66% (good, but not enough)
- Average return per trade: ~3% (too small)

**Root Causes**:
1. **No profit-taking rules**: Positions held indefinitely
2. **No stop-loss optimization**: Losing trades cut too early or too late
3. **Position sizing too conservative**: Only $2-6 per trade
4. **No trailing stops**: Missing upside capture

**Action Required**:
1. ✅ Implement profit-taking rules:
   - Take 50% profit at +5%
   - Take 25% profit at +10%
   - Let 25% run with trailing stop
2. ✅ Optimize stop-losses:
   - Use ATR-based stops (already implemented, verify usage)
   - Dynamic stops based on volatility
   - Max loss: 2% per trade
3. ✅ Increase position sizes:
   - Scale with confidence score
   - Higher confidence = larger position
   - Max 5% of portfolio per position
4. ✅ Add trailing stops:
   - Trail by 2x ATR once in profit
   - Lock in minimum 3% profit

**Expected Impact**: 3-5x improvement in profit per trade ($0.28 → $0.84-1.40)

---

### Gap 3: Options Income Stream Not Active ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State**:
- Options profit planner exists (`scripts/options_profit_planner.py`)
- Rule #1 options strategy implemented
- **Reality**: $0 allocated to options, no covered calls active

**Target**: $10/day from options premiums (10% of North Star goal)

**Action Required**:
1. ✅ Activate options accumulation strategy:
   - Allocate 5% of daily investment to options reserve
   - Target: 50 shares of NVDA/GOOGL/AMZN for covered calls
   - Timeline: 3-6 months at current pace
2. ✅ Implement covered call selling:
   - Once 50+ shares accumulated, sell weekly calls
   - Target: 0.5-1% premium per week
   - Example: 50 NVDA shares × $500/share = $25k → $125-250/week = $18-36/day
3. ✅ Add cash-secured puts:
   - Sell puts on high-conviction stocks
   - Collect premium while waiting for entry
   - Target: $5-10/day additional income
4. ✅ Integrate options planner into daily workflow:
   - Run after each trading day
   - Track gap to $10/day target
   - Auto-adjust accumulation pace

**Expected Impact**: +$10-20/day from options premiums

**Timeline**: 3-6 months to accumulate enough shares

---

### Gap 4: Exit Strategy Missing ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State**:
- Positions held indefinitely (no exit rules)
- No profit-taking mechanism
- No rebalancing based on performance

**Impact**:
- Winning trades turn into losing trades
- Missing profit capture opportunities
- Portfolio becomes unbalanced

**Action Required**:
1. ✅ Implement time-based exits:
   - Close positions after 30 days if no progress
   - Rebalance monthly
2. ✅ Implement performance-based exits:
   - Take profit at +10% (50% of position)
   - Take profit at +20% (another 25%)
   - Let 25% run with trailing stop
3. ✅ Implement momentum-based exits:
   - Exit when MACD turns bearish
   - Exit when RSI > 80 (overbought)
   - Exit when volume drops 50% below average
4. ✅ Add rebalancing logic:
   - Monthly portfolio review
   - Trim winners, add to losers (mean reversion)
   - Or: Let winners run, cut losers (momentum)

**Expected Impact**: 2-3x improvement in profit capture

---

### Gap 5: Multiple Income Streams Not Maximized ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State**:
- Only equity trading active
- Options: Not active
- Dividends: Not tracked/optimized
- High-yield cash: Not available (paper trading)

**Action Required**:
1. ✅ **Dividend Optimization**:
   - Add REIT allocation (VNQ) for dividend income
   - Target: 3-4% yield = $0.30-0.40/day on $10k allocation
   - Track dividend dates and optimize timing
2. ✅ **High-Yield Cash** (when live):
   - Enroll in Alpaca 3.56% APY program
   - Idle cash earns interest
   - Target: $0.10-0.50/day on $10k-50k cash
3. ✅ **Options Premiums** (see Gap 3)
4. ✅ **Crypto Weekend Trading**:
   - Already implemented (Tier 5)
   - Verify it's active and optimized
   - Target: +$1-2/day from weekend volatility

**Expected Impact**: +$1-3/day from additional income streams

---

### Gap 6: Agent Systems Not Fully Enabled ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State**:
- LLM Council: Status unknown (should be enabled per CEO directive)
- DeepAgents: Status unknown
- Multi-LLM Analysis: Should be enabled
- Go ADK: Status unknown

**CEO Directive (Nov 24, 2025)**: "Enable ALL dormant systems NOW! We have $100/mo budget."

**Action Required**:
1. ✅ Verify LLM Council is enabled and active
2. ✅ Verify DeepAgents planning system is active
3. ✅ Verify Multi-LLM sentiment analysis is active
4. ✅ Enable Go ADK if service available
5. ✅ Monitor costs (should be <$100/month)
6. ✅ Track ROI: Does AI improve win rate/profit enough to justify cost?

**Expected Impact**: 5-10% improvement in win rate, better trade selection

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Over-Scaling Too Fast
**Mitigation**:
- Gradual scaling: 10 → 100 → 500 → 1,500 over 6 months
- Test each level for 2 weeks before scaling up
- Monitor win rate and Sharpe ratio at each level

### Risk 2: Options Income Delayed
**Mitigation**:
- Start accumulation immediately (5% daily)
- Consider accelerating if gap to $10/day is large
- Alternative: Use margin for covered calls (if approved)

### Risk 3: Profit Per Trade Doesn't Improve
**Mitigation**:
- A/B test exit strategies
- Use backtest engine to validate
- Fallback: Scale capital more aggressively

### Risk 4: System Reliability Drops
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain 99%+ reliability requirement
- Add more monitoring and alerts
- Don't scale if reliability drops
