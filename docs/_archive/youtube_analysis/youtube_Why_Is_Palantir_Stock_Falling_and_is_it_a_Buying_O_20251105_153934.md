[00:00] Palanteer reported absolutely
[00:01] spectacular quarterly financial results
[00:04] and the stock price is down 2.7%
[00:07] following that earnings announcement. So
[00:10] I know many of you are left wondering
[00:12] how could a stock perform the way
[00:14] Palanteer performed reporting revenue
[00:16] growth over 60% operating profit margin
[00:19] cash flow all better than expected
[00:22] raising the guidance for the full year
[00:24] 2025
[00:25] billions of dollars in new deals signed
[00:27] and yet the stock price is down now it's
[00:30] down over 2.3%
[00:32] following the announcement so I'll
[00:34] discuss why this is the case and why
[00:36] this is what I warned Palunteer stock
[00:38] investors about coming into this
[00:41] earnings result. Remember I did a
[00:42] earnings preview video where I
[00:44] highlighted that Palunteer stock price
[00:47] was priced nearly to perfection and if
[00:50] the company perfor reported anything
[00:52] less than absolutely spectacular results
[00:55] that there was huge downside possible
[00:57] for Palanteer shares and you're seeing
[01:00] some of the evidence of that what I said
[01:02] in the earnings preview. Regardless,
[01:04] I'll review these results and provide
[01:07] more detail on why the stock price is
[01:09] falling. I'll also share with you my
[01:12] proprietary discounted cash flow
[01:13] valuation, which calculates a fair value
[01:16] for Palunteer stock and update my buy or
[01:18] sell rating on this excellent growth
[01:21] stock.

[01:30] Palanteer second quarter US revenue grew
[01:34] 77% but more importantly for me US
[01:37] commercial revenue grew 121%
[01:40] year-over-year and 29% from the previous
[01:43] quarter. I've been talking about for a
[01:45] few years now how this is Palunteer's
[01:47] biggest opportunity is in enterprise
[01:50] business. We all know how great
[01:52] Palunteer is with governments and
[01:54] government institutions. Governments
[01:56] have deep pockets and can spend and can
[01:58] afford Palanteer services. Palunteer is
[02:01] undoubtedly the bestin-class in this
[02:03] category. But what Palanteer struggles
[02:06] with is offering this service at a low
[02:08] enough price to attract a lot more
[02:10] customers. It has relatively few
[02:12] customers, but each customer pays
[02:15] Palunteer a lot of money. And so if
[02:17] Palunteer can gain traction among US
[02:20] enterprises, that's a broader
[02:22] opportunity, a larger opportunity
[02:24] because there are millions of businesses
[02:26] worldwide whereas there is relatively
[02:28] fewer government institutions. And
[02:30] you've seen Palunteer achieve great
[02:33] success in unlocking this opportunity
[02:35] and yet another quarter of excellent
[02:37] performance here with US commercial
[02:40] revenue growing 121%. Of course, what's
[02:44] missing from its third quarter 2025
[02:47] highlights is commercial revenue from
[02:50] outside the United States or government
[02:52] revenue from outside the United States.
[02:55] And you've heard me talk about this
[02:56] before. When a management team doesn't
[02:59] like a certain figure or doesn't like
[03:01] what it shows, it will bury that figure
[03:04] in like page 17 of a financial statement
[03:08] or of a press release. And so you don't
[03:11] see these things that show Palunteer in
[03:13] a less than flattering light. And
[03:15] Palanteer is not the only one that does
[03:17] this. I recently did a video about
[03:20] United Health and why its management
[03:23] team put certain figures way down below.
[03:26] It was figures that they didn't really
[03:28] want you to pay attention to and they
[03:30] wanted you to look deeper to find. I
[03:32] wouldn't be surprised if that's the
[03:34] similar thinking here with Palanteer.
[03:36] Overall revenue increased by 63%
[03:39] year-over-year and 18% from the previous
[03:42] quarter to 1.18 billion. They closed a
[03:46] record setting $2.8 billion of total
[03:49] contract value which was up 151%
[03:53] year-over-year.
[03:54] US commercial remaining deal value of
[03:57] 3.6 billion was up 199%.
[04:01] The company is signing new contracts at
[04:04] an accelerating rate. And the reason
[04:06] this is important is because this
[04:08] eventually will turn into revenue. So
[04:11] investors are looking at this as a sign
[04:13] of what future revenue growth will look
[04:15] like. And Palanteer keeps setting new
[04:17] records in these new customer signings
[04:20] and order value. Palanteer's
[04:22] profitability and cash flow has also
[04:24] been impressive. Not only are they
[04:26] growing revenue, but they're growing
[04:27] revenue very profitably. Its income from
[04:30] operations came in at 393 million which
[04:33] represented a 33% operating profit
[04:36] margin that's been moving higher at a
[04:39] rapid rate. As I mentioned, Palanteer
[04:41] services its business overall is just an
[04:45] absolutely premium business. And the
[04:47] only reason why I don't own Palunteer
[04:50] stock myself is because the stock is so
[04:53] expensive. And I'll talk a little bit
[04:55] more about that later in the video.
[04:57] Other than the valuation, nearly
[04:59] everything about Palunteer's business is
[05:02] attractive for long-term investors. The
[05:05] cash flow from operations, 508 million,
[05:07] represented a 43% margin. This is among
[05:10] the best of any of the 300 companies I'm
[05:13] following. The best of the best are
[05:15] around 60% and Palanteer at 43% while
[05:19] they're still growing revenue by 63% is
[05:22] truly impressive. Most of the companies
[05:24] that have very high operating profit
[05:26] margins are not growing revenue by 63%.
[05:30] They're more mature companies like Visa
[05:32] and Mastercard and Nvidia is one of the
[05:35] newer ones that's up here with great
[05:37] cash flow from operations to sales
[05:39] ratios and also great revenue growth.
[05:42] But those kinds of companies are
[05:44] relatively few and far between.
[05:46] Palanteer also has one of the best
[05:48] balance sheets of any company with $6.4
[05:51] 4 billion in cash and equivalence and
[05:54] zero debt. Now, this cash balance is
[05:57] growing so large that a lot of investors
[05:59] are complaining about this. They want
[06:01] Palunteer to do something with this
[06:03] money. Either do a share buyback or make
[06:05] an acquisition or offer customers maybe
[06:08] better terms in order to attract new
[06:11] deals. Right? I mentioned some of their
[06:14] customers might not be able to afford
[06:16] their services. Palunteer can get
[06:19] creative and say, "Look, we're so
[06:20] confident in the value we will add to
[06:23] your business that we'll provide our
[06:25] service for 12 months for free and if
[06:28] you don't see the value in that, then
[06:30] you don't have to pay us back. But if
[06:32] you see the value in that, then you pay
[06:34] us back 12 months later." or telling
[06:37] them that no, regardless of how you feel
[06:39] about the value, you still have to pay
[06:42] us back, but we'll give you 12 months to
[06:44] pay us back or we'll give you 24 months
[06:46] to pay us back. Palanteer can afford to
[06:48] get creative like that because they have
[06:50] $6 billion over $6 billion on the
[06:53] balance sheet and right now they're
[06:55] putting it in US treasuries or
[06:57] government bonds or money market
[06:59] accounts which is probably giving them
[07:01] around 4% yield. I'm relatively
[07:05] confident that they can earn a better
[07:06] yield by getting creative with this
[07:09] capital and offering some better terms
[07:12] to some of their customers or potential
[07:14] customers. And I wouldn't be surprised
[07:16] if they're already doing that because of
[07:18] the growth they're seeing in their US
[07:20] commercial business. I wouldn't be
[07:22] surprised if they're already using the
[07:24] balance sheet in order to attract more
[07:26] customers. Now, I mentioned I would talk
[07:28] about valuation. And look at this here.
[07:30] Palanteer is trading at a forward PE of
[07:33] 256.
[07:35] By the way, I'm getting this chart from
[07:36] fiscal.ai. There's a link in the
[07:39] description if you're interested in
[07:40] these kinds of charts. Palanteer's
[07:42] forward PE of 256 is the most expensive
[07:46] it's been going all the way back to 2023
[07:50] when the company uh was just getting
[07:52] underway of reporting consistent
[07:54] profitability. At that moment, it was
[07:56] trading at a forward PE of around 30 to
[07:59] 35. It's now trading at a forward PE of
[08:02] 256. Of course, you're getting a better
[08:05] business than you were getting back
[08:06] then, but the valuation is nearly 10
[08:09] times the average stock in the S&P 500.
[08:11] Furthermore, when I look at valuation
[08:13] using my proprietary discounted cash
[08:15] flow model, it's also looking
[08:18] overvalued. The stock price at $27 is
[08:21] trading near the 52- week high and it's
[08:24] well above the $50 intrinsic value per
[08:26] share I calculated. So all of these
[08:28] valuation concerns are the reason why
[08:30] the stock price is down 1.5% in the
[08:34] aftermarket hours following this
[08:36] earnings release which was absolutely
[08:38] spectacular. I mean, I can't imagine how
[08:41] many times it's hasn't been very many
[08:44] times I've seen an earnings release
[08:46] where a company reported 63%
[08:48] year-over-year growth in revenue,
[08:50] reported no contract signings, which are
[08:53] up 151%.
[08:55] Uh, remaining deal value up 199% with
[08:59] profits and profit margins and cash flow
[09:02] improving. raising the guidance for the
[09:04] rest of the year on revenue, on cash
[09:06] flow, on operating income, raising the
[09:09] guidance across the board. And yet the
[09:11] stock price falling by 1.8%. That's
[09:14] almost unheard of. But that just goes to
[09:16] show how expensive the valuation had
[09:18] gotten coming into the earnings release.
[09:21] And that just goes to show, remember I
[09:23] did that earnings preview where I said I
[09:25] wouldn't be buying Palunteer stock ahead
[09:27] of earnings. And I warned everyone I
[09:29] wouldn't be buying Palunteer stock ahead
[09:31] of earnings. There is very limited
[09:33] upside, but there is huge downside. The
[09:35] stock could have crashed by 20, 30, or
[09:38] 40%. If any of those numbers weren't as
[09:41] spectacular as they were, imagine if
[09:44] they reported instead of 63% revenue
[09:47] growth, if it was 40% growth, right?
[09:50] That would still be a great number on
[09:52] the top line, but imagine what would
[09:54] happen to the stock price. Or imagine
[09:57] they reported some factor causing
[09:59] profitability to fall below what they
[10:02] were forecasting or some difficulty in
[10:04] signing new contract or something with
[10:07] the government shutdown and government's
[10:09] cutting spending hurting Palanteer's
[10:11] contract revenue during the quarter,
[10:13] right? a number of things, any one of
[10:16] those things, if they were to come to
[10:18] fruition during the quarter, and this
[10:20] stock price could be trading below 150
[10:24] following the earnings release very
[10:25] easily. But thankfully for investors,
[10:28] the company reported absolutely
[10:30] spectacular results and the stock price
[10:32] is declining anyway. This is the danger
[10:35] you encounter when you're investing in
[10:37] stocks that are already trading at
[10:39] nosebleleed valuations. they're already
[10:42] incorporating all of these excellent
[10:44] results for many many quarters ahead
[10:47] into the future. And so when you get a
[10:50] number like you did today, it fails to
[10:52] create upside for the stock. And that's
[10:54] what I've been talking about here with
[10:56] Palunteer at these super expensive
[10:59] valuations that there's limited upside
[11:01] from here while the downside is huge.
[11:04] So, I've had Palunteer stock rated as a
[11:06] hold and following these earnings
[11:08] results, I will be reiterating that hold
[11:11] rating. It's a great company delivering
[11:13] excellent performance with excellent
[11:16] prospects for several quarters, perhaps
[11:19] even several years into the future, but
[11:21] the valuation I feel already
[11:23] incorporates all of those excellent
[11:26] prospects looking ahead several years.
[11:28] And so, I don't see very much upside in
[11:31] buying Palunteer stock today. Hey,
