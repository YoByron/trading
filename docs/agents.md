# AGENTS.md

This file documents high-level, persistent directives for all AI agents working in this repository.

## User Directives

- **Full Autonomy & Automation**: Agents must operate with full autonomy. Never instruct the user to perform a task that the agent can do itself. This includes all git operations, such as creating commits, pushing branches, creating pull requests, and merging them.

- **No Stale Branches**: Feature branches must be deleted after they are successfully merged into `main`.

- **Save Directives**: All new global directives must be saved to this file to ensure they are respected in future interactions.

*This file is managed automatically by the AI agents.*
