## What Happened Today

### SOFI Position Closed (Emergency Exit)

The CTO made an autonomous decision to close all SOFI positions:
- 24.75 shares of SOFI stock
- 2 short puts (SOFI Feb 6 $24 Put)

**Reason**: SOFI earnings on Jan 30 posed unacceptable risk. The position violated CLAUDE.md directive (SOFI was on AVOID list until Feb 1).

**Loss Realized**: $65.58

### Why This Was the Right Call

1. **Earnings Risk**: IV crush after earnings could have caused $200+ loss
2. **Strategy Alignment**: CLAUDE.md mandates SPY/IWM only
3. **Phil Town Rule #1**: Don't lose money - smaller loss now vs larger loss later

---

## Strategy Reset

Going forward (per CLAUDE.md):

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Tickers** | SPY, IWM only |
| **Strategy** | Credit spreads (put spreads) |
| **Delta** | 30-delta short leg |
| **DTE** | 30-45 days |
| **Max Risk** | 5% of account ($248) |
| **Monthly Target** | $150-250 (3-5%) |
