| 2-Year | 4.30% |
| 5-Year | 4.35% |
| 10-Year | 4.50% |
| 30-Year | 4.70% |

**Yield Curve Spread (10Y-2Y)**: +0.20%

**Curve Status**: Normal (positive slope)

*Data source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API*

## Risk Metrics

- **Max Position Size**: 2% of portfolio (Kelly Criterion)
- **Stop Loss**: Volatility-adjusted per position
- **Circuit Breakers**: Active (no triggers today)

## Sharpe Ratio & Backtesting Strategy

### Our Sharpe Ratio Calculation

The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns. We calculate it as:

```
Sharpe = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility
```

**Current Metrics:**
| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.00 | > 1.0 |
| **Win Rate** | 0.0% | > 80% |
| **Total Trades** | 0 | Ongoing |

### Backtesting Strategy: Iron Condors on SPY

Our backtesting validates our iron condor strategy before live execution:

1. **Historical Data**: 2+ years of SPY options chain data
2. **Entry Rules**:
   - Sell 15-20 delta put spread (bull put)
   - Sell 15-20 delta call spread (bear call)
   - 30-45 DTE expiration
3. **Exit Rules**:
   - 50% max profit target
   - 200% stop-loss on either side
   - Close at 21 DTE (gamma risk)
4. **Position Sizing**: Max 5% portfolio risk per trade

### Why Iron Condors?

Iron condors outperform simple credit spreads because:
- **Defined risk** on BOTH sides (put AND call)
- **86% win rate** at 15-delta (validated)
- **1.5:1 reward/risk** ratio (better than credit spreads' 0.5:1)
- Profits in range-bound markets (most of the time)

### Technologies Used Today

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|------------|------|
| **Decision Engine** | Claude Opus 4.5 | Final trade approval, risk assessment |
| **Cost-Optimized LLM** | OpenRouter (DeepSeek/Kimi) | Sentiment analysis, market research |
| **Knowledge Base** | Vertex AI RAG | Query 200+ lessons learned |
| **Retrieval** | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Semantic search over trade history |
| **Broker** | Alpaca API | Paper trading execution |
| **Data** | FRED API | Treasury yields, macro indicators |

### How It Works

1. **Market Data Ingestion**: Alpaca streams real-time quotes and positions
2. **Gate Pipeline**: Sequential checks (Momentum → Sentiment → Risk)
3. **RAG Query**: System retrieves similar past trades and lessons
4. **Claude Decision**: Final approval with full context (86% accuracy)
5. **Execution**: Order submitted to Alpaca if all gates pass
