# 🐛 Bug Squashed: docs(ralph): Auto-publish discovery blog post

*January 25, 2026*

---

Self-healing CI in action! Our AI caught and fixed this issue automatically: 🐛

## What Ralph Found

**Discovery:** docs(ralph): Auto-publish discovery blog post


## Technical Details

Automated fix applied by Ralph Loop CI



## Ralph Loop Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Iterations** | 1 |
| **API Cost** | $0.050 |
| **Outcome** | ai_fix_applied |
| **Timestamp** | 2026-01-25 04:08 UTC |


## Why This Matters

This improvement was made **completely autonomously** by our AI-powered CI system:

1. **Ralph Loop** detected an issue (failing tests, lint errors, or improvement opportunity)
2. **Claude API** analyzed the problem and generated a fix
3. **Automated testing** verified the fix worked
4. **Auto-commit** pushed the change to main
5. **This blog post** was auto-generated to share the discovery

### The Power of Autonomous AI Coding

This is what 24/7 AI-powered development looks like. While the team sleeps, Ralph:

- 🔍 Monitors for issues every 6 hours
- 🧠 Uses Claude to understand and fix problems
- ✅ Runs comprehensive test suites
- 📝 Documents discoveries automatically
- 💰 Tracks costs (this fix cost just $0.050!)

## How We Built Ralph

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum methodology](https://github.com/Th0rgal/opencode-ralph-wiggum):

```python
# Simplified Ralph Loop
while not tests_pass and iterations < max_iterations:
    response = claude_api.fix(failure_context)
    apply_changes(response)
    tests_pass = run_pytest()
    iterations += 1
```

Key features:
- **Struggle Detection**: Stops if AI gets stuck (saves API costs)
- **Cost Budgeting**: Max $5 per run to prevent runaway spending
- **Auto-commits**: Changes are committed and pushed automatically
- **Self-documentation**: Every fix generates a blog post (like this one!)

## Try It Yourself

Want to add autonomous AI coding to your project?

```bash
# Install Ralph Loop
pip install anthropic

# Run with your failing tests
python scripts/ralph_loop.py --task fix_tests --max-iterations 5 --max-cost 2.00
```
