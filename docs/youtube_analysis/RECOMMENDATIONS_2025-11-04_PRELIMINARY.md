## AMZN Recommendation: **HIGH PRIORITY - ADD TO TIER 2**

### ✅ Why AMZN Fits Our Strategy

**Fundamental Catalyst**:
- $38B multi-year deal = material, predictable revenue/profit impact
- AWS is Amazon's highest-margin business (35% operating margin)
- First OpenAI-Amazon deal → likely to expand over time
- Validates Amazon's AI infrastructure leadership

**Technical Momentum**:
- +5% rally on announcement with strong volume
- Breaking out of consolidation phase
- "Finally starting to catch a rally" after Q3 earnings beat
- Analyst confirms: "Best stocks to buy now"

**Valuation Support**:
- 15% upside to conservative fair value ($295)
- Fair value likely to increase when $7B/year revenue added to DCF model
- 2027+ free cash flow estimates rising (+$7B annually)
- Still undervalued after +5% rally

**Sector Alignment**:
- Cloud/AI infrastructure = high-growth disruptive sector (Tier 2 target)
- Complements existing NVDA holding (both benefit from AI infrastructure boom)
- Strategic partnership with OpenAI = long-term competitive moat

**Analyst Credibility**:
- Parkev Tatevosian is a CFA (credible financial analysis)
- Personal skin in the game (owns AMZN + NVDA stocks)
- Consistent track record (recommended both stocks all year)
- Detailed DCF methodology (not hype-based recommendation)

### Entry Strategy

**Entry Zones** (in priority order):
1. **$245-250**: Strong support zone (pre-announcement consolidation) - BEST VALUE
2. **$256-258**: Current price (momentum entry if pullback occurs)
3. **$260-265**: Breakout confirmation above resistance

**Profit Targets**:
1. **$280**: +9% from current (conservative, 30-60 days)
2. **$295**: +15% (analyst fair value, 3-6 months)
3. **$320**: +25% (if deal extensions announced, 12+ months)

**Stop Loss**:
- **$240**: -6.25% from current price (below pre-announcement support)
- Protects against deal falling through or macro selloff

### Risk Assessment

**Bullish Factors** ✅:
- Multi-year revenue visibility ($38B commitment)
- High-margin business (35% operating margins)
- Strategic first deal (likely to expand)
- Market validated (+5% rally with conviction)
- Still undervalued post-rally (15% upside)
- Analyst reiterating buy, adding to own position

**Risk Factors** ⚠️:
- **Execution Risk**: Can AWS scale infrastructure fast enough?
- **Supply Chain**: Dependent on Nvidia GPU availability
- **OpenAI Financial Health**: Can OpenAI afford $7B/year?
- **Competition**: Microsoft Azure historically primary OpenAI partner
- **Concentration**: Single large customer dependency
- **Correlation**: AMZN + NVDA both benefit (diversification risk)

**Mitigation**:
- Dollar-cost averaging entry ($2/day Tier 2 allocation)
- Stop-loss at $240 limits downside to 6%
- Position sizing: Max 10% of portfolio (standard Tier 2 rule)
- Monitor AWS quarterly results for deal progress
