## How AMZN Fits Our Strategy

**Current Tier 2 Holdings**:

- High-growth disruptive sector ✅
- 15-25% annual return potential ✅
- Medium risk profile ✅

**Synergy**:
- NVDA makes the GPUs
- AMZN hosts the GPUs in AWS data centers
- OpenAI uses both for ChatGPT
- All three benefit from AI infrastructure boom

---

## Entry/Exit Strategy

### Recommended Entry Points (in priority order)

1. **$245-250** (BEST VALUE - strong support zone)
   - Pre-announcement consolidation area
   - 4% pullback from current price
   - Wait for this if patient

2. **$256-258** (CURRENT PRICE - momentum entry)
   - Enter on any pullback to current levels
   - Moderate value, confirmed momentum
   - Good risk/reward

3. **$260-265** (BREAKOUT - confirmation)
   - Above resistance = breakout confirmed
   - Higher risk, stronger momentum signal
   - Chase entry only if volume strong

### Profit Targets

1. **$280** (+9% from current) - Conservative, 30-60 days
2. **$295** (+15% from current) - Analyst fair value, 3-6 months
3. **$320** (+25% from current) - If deal expands, 12+ months

### Stop-Loss

**$240** (-6.25% from current)
- Below pre-announcement support
- Protects against deal falling through
- Limits max loss to 6%

---

## Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Right ✅

1. Deal generates $7B/year revenue as expected
2. OpenAI expands partnership (more revenue)
3. AWS growth accelerates (re-rating)
4. Stock reaches $295 fair value (15% gain)
5. Analyst upgrades fair value after incorporating deal
6. AI infrastructure boom continues

### What Could Go Wrong ⚠️

1. **Execution Risk**: AWS can't scale infrastructure fast enough
2. **Supply Chain**: Nvidia GPU shortage delays rollout
3. **OpenAI Financials**: Can't afford $7B/year commitment
4. **Competition**: Microsoft Azure wins more OpenAI business
5. **Macro**: Tech selloff drags all stocks down
6. **Concentration**: Over-reliance on single customer

### Mitigation Plan

- **Stop-loss** at $240 limits downside to 6%
- **Position sizing**: Max 10% of portfolio (standard Tier 2)
- **Dollar-cost averaging**: $2/day Tier 2 allocation spreads entry
- **Monitoring**: Track AWS quarterly results, OpenAI usage
- **Diversification**: Pair with NVDA (both benefit, but different businesses)

**Overall Risk**: MODERATE (manageable with proper position sizing)

## CEO Decision Options

### Option 1: Add AMZN as 3rd Tier 2 Stock (RECOMMENDED)

**Portfolio**: NVDA + GOOGL + AMZN
**Allocation**: $0.67/day per stock ($2/day split 3 ways)

**Pros**:
- Maximum diversification
- Cloud (AMZN) + Chips (NVDA) + AI Platform (GOOGL)
- All benefit from AI boom but different revenue sources
- Reduces single-stock risk

**Cons**:
- Smaller position sizes (harder to generate big returns)
- All tech-heavy (sector concentration risk)

---

### Option 2: Replace GOOGL with AMZN

**Portfolio**: NVDA + AMZN
**Allocation**: $1/day per stock ($2/day split 2 ways)

**Pros**:
- Larger positions (bigger returns potential)
- Cloud + Chips synergy (both benefit from OpenAI deal)
- Simpler to manage (2 stocks vs 3)

**Cons**:
- Lose search/advertising exposure (GOOGL)
- Higher single-stock risk
- GOOGL may outperform in different market conditions

---

### Option 3: Rotation Strategy (Most Complex)

**Portfolio**: Rotate between NVDA/GOOGL/AMZN based on momentum
**Allocation**: $2/day to strongest momentum signal each day

**Pros**:
- Maximize returns (ride the winner)
- Adaptive to market conditions
- Can capitalize on short-term momentum

**Cons**:
- Requires momentum system (MACD + RSI + Volume)
- More complex to implement and monitor
- Higher trading costs (more frequent trades)
- Need Month 2+ to implement (not ready yet)

---

## CTO Recommendation

**Preferred Option**: **Option 1** (Add AMZN as 3rd stock)

**Rationale**:
1. We're in R&D Phase - focus on learning, not big returns yet
2. Diversification reduces risk while building trading edge
3. Simple implementation (just add AMZN to rotation)
4. Can always consolidate to 2 stocks later if needed
5. Three 15-25% annual return stocks > Two 15-25% stocks

**Timeline**:
- **Immediate**: Add AMZN to watchlist (✅ already done)
- **This week**: Set up price alerts, configure sentiment analysis
- **Next 30 days**: Monitor AMZN alongside NVDA/GOOGL
- **Month 2**: Evaluate performance, adjust if needed

1. **Update CoreStrategy**
   - Add AMZN ticker to Tier 2 rotation

   - OpenAI usage monitoring

3. **Risk Management**
   - Implement stop-loss at $240

4. **Reporting**
