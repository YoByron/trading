## Specific Recommendations by Phase

### Phase 1-2 (Now - Days 1-60): Build Edge

**Current Focus**: Momentum system (MACD + RSI + Volume)
**AI Status**: ❌ DISABLED (correct)
**Reason**: Making $0.02/day, AI costs $0.06/day

**Actions**:
- ✅ Keep AI disabled
- ✅ Focus on RL system development
- ✅ Collect data for backtesting
- ⏭️ Prepare enhancements (code ready, don't enable)

### Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Validate

**Goal**: Win rate >60%, Sharpe >1.5, $10+/day profit
**AI Status**: ⚠️ EVALUATE for enabling

**Enable AI when**:
```python
if (daily_profit > 10 and fibonacci_phase >= 5 and sharpe_ratio > 1.5):
    enable_ai = True
```

**Quick Wins (Total: 1 day effort)**:
1. Chain-of-Thought prompting (1-2 hours)
2. Confidence weighting (2-3 hours)
3. Model routing (3-4 hours)

**Expected Impact**:
- Win rate: 60% → 65-68%
- Cost: $0.06/day → $0.01/day (with routing)
- Net benefit: +$1-2/day profit

### Phase 4-5 (Month 4-6+): Scale

**Goal**: $50-100+/day profit
**AI Status**: ✅ ENABLED with full features

**Enhancements**:
1. Self-consistency sampling (2-3 hours)
2. RAG for fundamentals (1-2 weeks)
3. News event categorization (1-2 weeks)
4. Reddit sentiment (2-3 weeks)
5. Market regime detection (1 week)

**Expected Impact**:
- Win rate: 68% → 72-75%
- Adaptive to all market conditions
- $100+/day achievable

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Current Cost Structure

**Unoptimized** (all 3 models every time):
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $0.036/day
- GPT-4o: $0.026/day
- Gemini Flash: $0.0008/day
- **Total: $0.063/day**

**Optimized** (model routing by complexity):
- Simple tasks (70%): Gemini Flash only = $0.0006/day
- Medium tasks (20%): Claude only = $0.007/day
- Complex tasks (10%): Full ensemble = $0.006/day
- **Total: $0.014/day (78% savings)**

### Routing Logic

```python
def classify_complexity(ticker, volatility, news_count, market_regime):
    if ticker in ['SPY', 'QQQ'] and market_regime == 'normal':
        return 'simple'  # Use Gemini Flash
    elif volatility > 30 or earnings_event:
        return 'complex'  # Use full ensemble
    else:
        return 'medium'  # Use Claude only
```

**Implementation**: 3-4 hours
**Savings**: 78% ($0.063 → $0.014/day)
**ROI**: Pays back in 5 days of usage

**Example**:
```python
weighted_decision = (
    claude_output * claude_confidence +
    gpt4_output * gpt4_confidence +
    gemini_output * gemini_confidence
) / sum(confidences)
```

### 3. Self-Consistency

**What**: Query each model 3x, take consensus
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Reduces variance
**When**: Phase 4 (when scaling)

### 4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**What**: Inject company fundamentals into prompt
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks
**Impact**: Grounds analysis in facts
**When**: Phase 4-5 (when scaling)

### 5. Market Regime Detection

**What**: Classify market (bull, bear, volatile, consolidation)
**Effort**: 1 week
**Impact**: Adaptive strategy
**When**: Phase 5 (advanced)
