            ### What Happened
            The daily-trading workflow completed but verification detected that trades may not have executed.

            ### Possible Causes
            1. Phil Town script analyzed but didn't place orders
            2. Insufficient buying power for CSPs
            3. Market conditions didn't meet entry criteria
            4. API errors during order submission

            ### Required Actions
            - [ ] Check [workflow logs](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            - [ ] Verify Alpaca account has orders
            - [ ] Review \`scripts/rule_one_trader.py\` output
            - [ ] Check \`data/trades_${date}.json\` exists

            ### Prevention
            This alert was added Jan 10, 2026 after discovering the system was in "zombie mode" - workflows succeeding but no trades executing.
