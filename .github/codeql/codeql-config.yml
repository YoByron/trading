  # Clear-text logging: Our mask_api_key function is a sanitizer
  # However, CodeQL doesn't support custom sanitizers in basic config
  # This file documents our security approach

# Security approach documentation:
# 1. All API keys MUST be masked before logging using mask_api_key()
# 2. Pattern: masked_key = mask_api_key(api_key); print(masked_key)
# 3. Pre-commit hook checks for direct API key logging patterns
# 4. Security workflow runs Bandit for additional Python security scanning
