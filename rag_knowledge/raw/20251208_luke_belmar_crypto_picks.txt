=== STRATEGY INTEGRATION ===

Current Tier 5 Portfolio (Weekend Crypto Strategy):
- BTC/USD: Core holding (24/7 trading)

- SOL/USD: NEW - High momentum play (Dec 2025)

Watchlist (Not Yet Tradeable):

Allocation Strategy:
- Equal-weight among BTC, ETH, SOL initially

5. Monitor ETF flows for institutional sentiment

=== PRICE TARGETS ===
