      "topic": "Market Reversal Probabilities",
      "insight": "The chance of a complete reversal in the market after a 2% or greater daily move in either direction is just 1% (over 20 years of data). The chance of a reversal after a selloff is twice as likely as a reversal after a rally of the same size.",
      "trading_rule": "After large market moves (2%+), expect continuation rather than reversal. Reversals are rare (1%) and more likely after selloffs than rallies.",
      "application": "Use this data to avoid premature position reversals after large moves. Consider mean-reversion trades more carefully after selloffs.",

      "insight": "Outlier Rank (OR) is an effective way to estimate exposure to outlier risk at a given IV level. Research shows that trading 16Δ SPY strangles with low OR and high IVR increases average P/L and decreases P/L volatility.",
      "trading_rule": "Favor trades with low Outlier Rank and high IV Rank when selling premium. This combination improves risk-adjusted returns.",
      "application": "Filter strangle trades using OR < threshold and IVR > 50. Particularly effective for 16 delta SPY strangles.",

      "topic": "ATM vs OTM Options Decay",
      "insight": "Options decay differently depending on whether they are at-the-money or out-of-the-money. ATM options decay faster after the 21 DTE mark, but they have more gamma risk.",
      "trading_rule": "ATM options are better for short-term trades (< 21 DTE) due to faster theta decay, but require careful gamma risk management. OTM options have more predictable decay patterns for longer-dated positions.",
      "application": "Use ATM options for aggressive theta harvesting in the final 3 weeks before expiration. Use OTM for safer, longer-term positions with lower gamma exposure.",
