      "content": "Implied Volatility (IV): Market's expectation of future volatility, derived from option prices via Black-Scholes. Realized Volatility (RV): Actual historical volatility calculated from price movements. Key relationship: IV tends to exceed RV on average (volatility risk premium). This is why option selling strategies have positive expected value. Measurement: IV from option chains (VIX for S&P 500). RV calculated as annualized standard deviation of log returns. IV/RV ratio > 1 means options are 'expensive' relative to historical norms.",

Where: ω = long-run variance weight, α = reaction to recent shock, β = persistence of volatility. Key properties: Volatility clusters (high vol follows high vol), Mean reversion (vol returns to long-run average), Asymmetry captured in EGARCH/GJR-GARCH (bad news increases vol more than good news).

Backwardation (inverted): Near-term IV > longer-term IV. Market stressed, expecting volatility to decline. Trading implications: Contango favors selling near-term options (time decay + vol crush). Backwardation favors buying near-term options (cheap relative to fear). Monitor VIX futures curve or VIXMT (mid-term) vs VIX. VIX/VIX3M ratio > 1 = backwardation (fear).

Rules of thumb: IV Percentile > 50%: Favor selling strategies (CSP, covered calls). IV Percentile < 30%: Favor buying strategies (long puts/calls, debit spreads). IV Percentile 30-50%: Neutral, smaller positions. TastyTrade research shows selling at high IV rank significantly improves win rates.",

This reflects crash risk premium - investors pay more for downside protection. Measuring skew: Compare 25-delta put IV to 25-delta call IV. Large negative skew = high crash fear (puts expensive). Flat or positive skew = complacency. Trading skew: When skew is steep, selling OTM puts captures high premium. When skew is flat, puts are cheap for hedging.",
