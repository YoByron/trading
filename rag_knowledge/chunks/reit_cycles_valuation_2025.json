RECOVERY (Bottom to Growth)\n- Occupancy rising from trough\n- No new construction\n- Rent growth begins\n- Signal: Buy REITs aggressively\n\n2. EXPANSION (Growth Phase)\n- Occupancy above long-term average\n- New construction begins\n- Rent growth accelerates\n- Signal: Hold, selective adds\n\n3. HYPERSUPPLY (Peak to Decline)\n- New supply exceeds demand\n- Occupancy peaks, then falls\n- Rent growth slows\n- Signal: Reduce exposure, raise quality\n\n4. RECESSION (Decline Phase)\n- Occupancy falls below average\n- No new construction starts\n- Rent decline possible\n- Signal: Defensive REITs only (healthcare, storage)\n\nCycle length: 7-10 years on average.",

REITs can perform well at 5% rates if rates are falling.\n\nDuration risk: Average REIT has 4-6 year duration. 1% rate rise → ~5% price decline (short-term).",
