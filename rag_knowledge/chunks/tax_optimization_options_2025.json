      "content": "Section 1256 contracts include regulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts, non-equity options, dealer equity options, and dealer securities futures contracts. These receive special tax treatment: 60% of gains taxed as long-term capital gains (max 20%), 40% as short-term (up to 37%). This applies regardless of holding period. SPX, XSP, and other index options qualify. ETF options (SPY, QQQ) do NOT qualify - they're taxed as regular short-term/long-term gains. Blended rate for Section 1256: approximately 26.8% vs potentially 37% for short-term trades.",

      "topic": "Wash Sale Rule - The 30-Day Trap",
      "content": "The wash sale rule disallows loss deductions if you buy 'substantially identical' securities within 30 days before or after selling at a loss. For options: buying a call after selling stock at loss, buying stock after selling put at loss, or rolling options can trigger wash sales. The disallowed loss gets added to the cost basis of the new position. CRITICAL: Wash sales apply across ALL your accounts (IRA, brokerage, spouse accounts). Options on the same underlying are generally considered substantially identical.",
      "key_insight": "A loss is not 'lost' - it increases your cost basis. But it delays the tax benefit, which has time-value cost.",
      "application": "When rolling losing options positions, be aware the loss may be disallowed. Consider waiting 31 days before re-entering similar positions if tax-loss harvesting is important.",

      "content": "IRS straddle rules apply when you hold offsetting positions that substantially diminish risk of loss. Effects: (1) Losses on one leg may be deferred until other leg closed. (2) Holding period suspended for long positions. (3) Interest/carrying costs may not be deductible. Identified straddles allow some relief if you properly identify positions. Qualified covered calls are exempt from straddle rules if: (1) Call is out-of-money, (2) Expires in less than 12 months, (3) No downside protection purchased.",
      "key_insight": "Complex hedged positions can create unexpected tax consequences. Simple strategies (naked puts, covered calls) have cleaner tax treatment.",

      "topic": "Option Assignment Tax Treatment",
      "content": "When options are exercised/assigned, the premium becomes part of the stock transaction: CALL SOLD (covered call): Premium added to sale price. If assigned, long-term/short-term depends on stock holding period. PUT SOLD (cash-secured put): Premium reduces cost basis of acquired shares. Holding period starts at assignment. CALL BOUGHT: Premium added to cost basis of purchased shares. PUT BOUGHT: If exercised, premium subtracted from sale proceeds. Key insight: Assignment is NOT a taxable event for the option itself - it merges into the stock transaction.",

(3) Up to $3,000 excess losses can offset ordinary income. (4) Remaining losses carry forward indefinitely. Strategy: In December, review all positions. Close losers to harvest losses.

No wash sale rules apply. Losses fully deductible (no $3,000 cap). Requirements for TTS: (1) Substantial trading activity, (2) Trade nearly every day, (3) Seek to profit from short-term swings, (4) Significant time devoted to trading. Election must be filed by April 15 of the prior year. Most retail traders don't qualify - requires near full-time trading activity.",
