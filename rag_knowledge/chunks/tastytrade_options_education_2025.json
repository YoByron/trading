      "content": "A covered call is created by owning 100 shares of stock and selling 1 call option against those shares. The 'covered' aspect means your obligation to deliver shares is covered by your existing position. Key mechanics: (1) Collect premium upfront - this is yours to keep regardless of outcome. (2) Strike selection determines your max profit - shares get called away at strike price if ITM at expiration. (3) Breakeven = stock purchase price - premium received. (4) Best used when: slightly bullish, expecting sideways movement, or willing to sell at strike price. Risk: Unlimited downside on stock minus the premium collected. Max profit: (Strike - Stock Price) + Premium.",

(2) ATM strikes maximize premium but high assignment risk. (3) OTM strikes (delta 0.20-0.25) provide more upside room but less premium. (4) Consider cost basis - sell strikes above your cost basis to ensure profit if assigned. (5) IV Rank above 30 is ideal for selling premium. Research shows delta 0.30 strikes outperform over thousands of occurrences due to positive theta decay and reasonable probability of keeping shares.",

      "content": "IV Rank measures where current implied volatility sits relative to its 52-week range. Formula: IV Rank = (Current IV - 52-week Low IV) / (52-week High IV - 52-week Low IV) * 100. Interpretation: IV Rank 0% = IV at 52-week low (options cheap). IV Rank 50% = IV at midpoint. IV Rank 100% = IV at 52-week high (options expensive). Trading implications: IV Rank > 50% = Sell premium (options overpriced, likely to contract). IV Rank < 30% = Buy premium or avoid selling (options fairly priced). IV Rank is superior to raw IV because it contextualizes volatility relative to the specific underlying's history.",

      "content": "IV Percentile counts the percentage of days over the past year where IV was lower than current IV. Example: IV Percentile of 80% means IV was lower than today 80% of the time in the past year. Key difference from IV Rank: IV Rank uses the range (high-low), IV Percentile uses frequency distribution. IV Percentile is less sensitive to one-time IV spikes. TastyTrade prefers IV Rank for entry decisions but both metrics are valuable. Use IV Rank > 50% AND IV Percentile > 50% for highest conviction premium selling setups.",

Max profit = Credit received (when underlying stays above short strike at expiration). Max loss = Width of spread - Credit received (when underlying below long strike). Breakeven = Short strike - Credit received. Probability of profit = 100% - Delta of short strike. Example: Stock at $100, sell $95 put for $2.00, buy $90 put for $0.75. Net credit = $1.25.

(3) ROTATE: Sell covered call against shares at strike above your cost basis. (4) If called away (call ITM at expiration): Sold shares at strike, keep premium. Return to step 1. (5) If not called away: Repeat covered call sales. Key: Only wheel stocks you genuinely want to own. The strategy works best with high-quality stocks that pay dividends. Collect premium in both phases while waiting for desired entry/exit prices.",

(5) Managing at 21 DTE avoids gamma risk spike. (6) Weekend theta: Options lose 2-3 days of theta over weekends (Friday close to Monday open). Strategy: Enter 30-45 DTE, exit at 21 DTE or 50% profit.

Risk mitigation: (1) Close or roll positions by 21 DTE to avoid gamma spike. (2) Avoid ATM strikes in final week. (3) Never hold short options through binary events (earnings) in final days. (4) Gamma is your enemy when short options - manage it actively. Research shows closing at 50% profit regardless of DTE outperforms holding to expiration.",

(2) Short options = Short vega (benefit from IV decrease). (3) Vega is highest for ATM options and decreases for ITM/OTM. (4) Longer-dated options have higher vega. Trading implications: Sell premium when IV Rank > 50% because IV mean reverts. IV contraction after entry benefits short vega positions. Earnings plays: IV typically inflates before earnings and collapses after (IV crush). Selling premium before earnings captures IV crush but faces event risk. Vega risk is often underestimated - a 10-point IV drop can significantly impact position P/L even without underlying movement.",

(2) Earnings premium selling: Sell strangles/iron condors right before earnings to capture IV crush. (3) Post-earnings drift: Direction often continues 1-2 weeks after earnings.
