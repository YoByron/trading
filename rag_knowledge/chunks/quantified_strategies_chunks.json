Enhancements: Add VIX filter (VIX > 20), add trend filter (price > 200 SMA). Implementation: Reduce size when RSI(2) > 5, full size only at extreme oversold. Holding period: 1-5 days.\n\nKey Takeaway: RSI(2) < 10 on SPY has 75%+ win rate over 30 years. Works because short-term oversold reverts quickly.",

Caution: 2008/2020 drawdowns were severe - use stop loss at -5%.\n\nKey Takeaway: VIX spikes create buying opportunities. VIX > 25 with SPY > 200 SMA has 70%+ win rate for 5-day holds.",
