      "content": "Pairs trading exploits mean reversion between correlated assets. Process: (1) Find highly correlated pair (correlation > 0.8). (2) Calculate spread (price ratio or difference). (3) Enter when spread deviates > 2 standard deviations. (4) Exit when spread reverts to mean. Classic pairs: XOM/CVX (oil), BAC/JPM (banks), GOOG/META (tech), SPY/IWM (large vs small cap). Risk: Correlation can break (regime change). Hedge ratio critical for proper sizing. Options enhance pairs trades by: Defined risk, lower capital, leverage.",

      "topic": "Dispersion Trading - Index vs Components",
      "content": "Dispersion trading exploits IV difference between index options and component options. Observation: Index IV is typically lower than weighted average of component IVs (correlation discount). Strategy: Sell index straddle, buy component straddles. Profit when realized correlation < implied correlation. Why it works: Index options price in diversification benefit. Component moves offset each other in index. When components move together less than expected, index vol is lower than component vol. Risk: High correlation events (2008, 2020) cause losses. Complex to execute with many positions.",
      "key_insight": "Dispersion profits from diversification - the reason index IV < component IV. Best when correlations are lower than priced.",
      "application": "Advanced strategy. For retail: simply note that SPY options are often 'cheaper' than individual stock options due to diversification.",

      "content": "Put-call parity: C - P = S - K*e^(-rT). Violations create arbitrage. Synthetic positions: Synthetic long stock = Long call + Short put (same strike/expiry). Synthetic short stock = Long put + Short call. If synthetic differs from actual stock price by more than transaction costs, arbitrage exists. Conversion: Long stock + Synthetic short (long put + short call). Reversal: Short stock + Synthetic long (long call + short put). These are 'risk-free' trades capturing pricing discrepancies. Reality: Rare in liquid markets. May exist briefly in volatile conditions or illiquid options.",
      "key_insight": "True put-call arbitrage is rare for retail traders. But understanding parity helps identify mispriced options and synthetic equivalents.",

Vertical spread: If IV increases too steeply across strikes (butterfly mispricing). Diagonal: Combination of calendar and vertical anomalies. Detection: Plot IV surface, look for unusual bumps or dips. Compare current surface to historical norms. Execution: Buy 'cheap' options, sell 'expensive' options to normalize surface. Risk: Surface anomalies may reflect genuine risk, not mispricing.",
      "key_insight": "Volatility surface anomalies indicate potential mispricing. But always ask: 'Why is this cheap/expensive?' before trading.",

(4) ETF vs index: Compare SPY vs SPX options for better execution. Analysis framework: Calculate expected value = (Probability of profit × Max gain) - (Probability of loss × Max loss).

(2) MM hedge by buying/selling underlying - your trades cause price impact. (3) MM are short gamma - they lose on big moves. Your long options profit when they lose.
