(2) USE EXPIRATION CLOSEST TO 45 DTE - optimal balance of theta decay and time to manage. (3) SELL OPTIONS WITH 30 DELTA - ~70% probability of expiring worthless, good risk/reward. (4) TAKE PROFIT AT 50% OF PREMIUM - maximizes win rate, reduces tail risk. (5) SCALING STUDY - compared scaling with higher delta vs more contracts. Result: scaling with more contracts exposed position to significantly larger losses ($3,500 vs $1,800 worst case). Recommendation: scale with delta adjustments rather than quantity. CRITICAL INSIGHT: All recommendations based on actual backtest data across thousands of trades and multiple market cycles, not theory.",

      "content": "GAMMA EXPLOSION: Gamma is highest for ATM options close to expiration. Front-month ATM option has MORE gamma than LEAPS at same strike because delta rapidly approaches 0 or 1.00. As expiration nears, ATM gamma spikes making 0DTE options EXTREMELY sensitive to small price changes. RISK CONUNDRUM: Closer to expiration = higher positive theta BUT also higher negative gamma. Stock price near strike = very high gamma AND theta simultaneously. Risk on short option can go from mild to hair-raising quickly if stock moves around strike. CONVEXITY WARNING: Double-edged sword - underestimating gamma risk near expiration causes significant P&L swings. Sizing positions properly is VITAL. 0DTE APPEAL VS DANGER: Fast profit potential drives 0DTE popularity, but heightened risk - much 'less time to be right'. AT EXPIRATION: ITM options behave like stock (delta near ±1), OTM options lose all sensitivity. With no further delta changes possible, gamma drops to ZERO.",

      "topic": "Three Ways to Manage Gamma Risk",
      "content": "GAMMA MANAGEMENT METHODS: (1) CLOSE - During expiration week when gamma growing and delta becoming unstable, close position entirely. Most conservative approach. (2) ROLL - Roll position to later expiration to reduce gamma exposure. Move from weekly to monthly, or monthly to 45+ DTE. Extends time and reduces gamma spike. (3) HEDGE - Actively adjust positions to maintain delta neutrality. Requires constant monitoring and execution. MARKET MAKER DYNAMICS: As expiration nears, market makers must hedge more aggressively due to gamma spikes. Can cause price pinning or increased volatility. Once gamma declines post-expiration, pressures subside. POSITIVE GAMMA ENVIRONMENT: Dealers long calls, hedging flows stabilize price movements, leads to LOWER volatility. NEGATIVE GAMMA ENVIRONMENT: Dealers short puts, hedging flows exacerbate price swings, leads to VOLATILITY EXPANSION. CRITICAL DECISION POINT: Expiration week is when gamma risk peaks - must have management plan in place BEFORE entering trade.",

Premium received may apply to margin requirement but full cash must be secured - hence 'cash-secured'. Buying power reduced by full obligation amount until position closed. MARKET OUTLOOK: Requires neutral-to-BULLISH forecast. Only use when comfortable OWNING underlying shares at that price - assignment always possible. Net cost (strike - premium) should be satisfactory entry point. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA: (1) Companies you want to own long-term. (2) Solid fundamentals - strong balance sheets, stable earnings, good market position. (3) Current price acceptable for long-term holding. (4) High liquidity with tight bid-ask spreads. WARNING: Never write more puts than equivalent shares you're willing/able to purchase. Strategy becomes speculative if overextended. Assignment should not be financial burden.",

Scale proportionally to normal stock position size. PROFIT/LOSS PROFILE: Max profit = premium received (limited upside). Max loss = strike price if stock goes to zero (substantial but capped). Breakeven = strike - premium received. TIME DECAY: Your friend - want option price to approach zero. VOLATILITY: Want IV to DECREASE after entry - makes closing position cheaper. MANAGEMENT: Can close anytime, roll to later expiration, or accept assignment and own shares. NEVER sell puts on stocks you don't want to own.",

      "content": "PMCC DEFINITION: Long call diagonal spread - buy long-term ITM call instead of owning stock, sell short-term OTM call against it for income. Reduces capital requirement vs traditional covered call. STRUCTURE: LONG LEG (LEAPS) - Buy deep ITM call with delta >0.75 and DTE ≥90 days. Acts as stock replacement. Minimal time value. SHORT LEG - Sell OTM call with delta <0.35 and DTE <60 days. Generates income. Must expire BEFORE long call. CAPITAL EFFICIENCY: PMCC requires fraction of capital vs buying 100 shares. Example: $10,000 stock position vs $2,000-3,000 LEAPS position for similar exposure. RISK: Max loss = net debit paid to enter trade (cost of LEAPS minus premium collected). Occurs if both options expire worthless. Loss capped unlike naked call (unlimited risk). NEVER sell short call without owning stock or long call - creates naked call position.",

TastyTrade rule: trade cost <75% of strike width. Example: $5 wide strikes = max cost $3.75. LONG CALL (LEAPS) SELECTION: (1) Delta ABOVE 0.75 (acts like stock). (2) DTE at least 90 days, preferably 6-12 months. (3) MINIMAL time value component - if time value too high, go deeper ITM. (4) Strike selection must satisfy structuring formula. SHORT CALL SELECTION: (1) Delta BELOW 0.35 (~30 delta common). (2) DTE fewer than 60 days (30-45 typical). (3) OTM strike above current price. (4) Expires BEFORE long call. ENTRY EXECUTION: Always 'leg in' - buy long call FIRST, then sell short call. Use LIMIT ORDERS - LEAPS have wide bid-ask spreads. Avoid volatile market times.",

ROLLING SHORT CALLS: When short call approaching expiration or hit profit target, roll out to next expiration cycle. Maintain similar delta (0.30-0.35) and OTM distance. CHALLENGED POSITION: If stock rallies above short strike, have three options: (1) Close entire position for profit (long call appreciated more than short call lost). (2) Buy back short call at loss, sell new call further out in time/price. (3) Accept assignment on short, exercise long call to deliver shares (rare - destroys remaining LEAPS time value). LEAPS DECAY MANAGEMENT: Monitor LEAPS time value. If <6 months remaining and significant time value left, consider rolling to new LEAPS further out. AVOID: Never let LEAPS get to <30 DTE - loses stock-like behavior. POSITION ADJUSTMENT: If stock drops significantly, can roll LEAPS down to lower strike to reduce cost basis and maintain delta.",

LONG PUT DIAGONAL: Buy longer-dated higher strike put, sell shorter-dated lower strike put. Bearish strategy. PMCC SPECIFIC: Subset of diagonal spreads with specific parameters - LEAPS delta >0.75 (deep ITM), short call delta <0.35 (OTM), designed as stock replacement with income generation. COST-TO-WIDTH REQUIREMENT: TastyTrade specifies <75% for PMCC. General diagonals may not follow this rule. USE CASE DIFFERENCE: PMCC = stock ownership alternative with income. General diagonal spread = directional speculation or volatility play. RATIO DIAGONALS: Advanced variation - sell MULTIPLE short-dated options against one long-dated option. Increases income but also risk. Example: 1:2 ratio - buy 1 long call, sell 2 short calls.",
