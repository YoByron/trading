Key considerations: (1) Stock selection is paramount - write calls only on stocks you want to own. (2) Strike selection determines risk/reward profile. (3) ITM calls provide more downside protection but cap upside. (4) OTM calls allow more upside but less protection. (5) ATM calls balance protection and upside. Return calculations: Static return = Premium / (Stock Price - Premium). If-called return = (Strike - Stock + Premium) / (Stock Price - Premium). Annualized return = Return * (365 / Days to Expiration). McMillan recommends minimum 1% per month static return for worthwhile trades.",

(2) Avoid stocks with pending news/earnings if seeking stable income. (3) Prefer optionable stocks with good liquidity (tight bid-ask spreads). (4) Look for stocks trading near support levels for technical backing. (5) Dividend-paying stocks add extra income but watch ex-dividend assignment risk. (6) Avoid stocks in strong uptrends if reluctant to have shares called away. (7) Consider sector diversification across covered call positions. The ideal candidate: stable, liquid, moderate IV, slight upward bias, you'd be happy to own at current price.",

Key equivalence: Short put = Synthetic covered call. If assigned, you own stock at strike minus premium (lower cost basis). Advantages over covered calls: (1) No stock ownership required upfront. (2) Lower capital requirement. (3) Can earn interest on cash collateral. (4) No uptick rule for puts. Risks: (1) Substantial loss if stock crashes. (2) Margin requirements can increase during volatility. (3) Assignment uncertainty. Best practices: Only sell puts on stocks you want to own at strike price. Use margin of safety - sell puts 5-10% below current price.",

Rationale: Collect more premium, profit if stock stays flat or declines moderately. Risk: Unlimited risk above upper breakeven. One call is covered, one is naked. Best scenario: Stock at short strike at expiration - maximum profit. Calculations: Lower breakeven = Stock price - Total premium. Upper breakeven = 2*Strike - Stock price + Total premium. McMillan warns: This is NOT for conservative investors. The naked call exposure creates substantial risk if stock surges. Use only with strict stops and on stocks unlikely to gap up significantly.",

(2) Buy OTM call for higher leverage but lower probability. (3) Sell call 1-2 strikes above purchased call. (4) Wider spread = higher max profit but higher cost.

(3) Can be profitable even if stock doesn't fall as much as expected. Strike selection: (1) Buy ATM or slightly ITM put for higher probability. (2) Sell put 1-3 strikes below purchased put. (3) Closer strikes = lower cost but narrower profit zone. Use when: Bearish but don't want unlimited risk exposure.",

Profit from large move in either direction. Cost = Total premium. Breakevens = Strike +/- Total premium. Short straddle: Sell ATM call + Sell ATM put. Profit from range-bound movement. Max profit = Total premium received. Unlimited risk in both directions. McMillan's analysis: Long straddles are appropriate when implied volatility is LOW and you expect a large move. Short straddles have high probability of some profit but unbounded risk - only for experienced traders with strict risk management. Historical data shows ATM straddles are often overpriced - favoring sellers over time.",

Short strangle: Sell OTM put + Sell OTM call. Wider profit zone than straddle, lower premium. McMillan recommends short strangles over short straddles for most traders because: (1) Wider profit zone reduces adjustment frequency. (2) Lower premium = Lower gamma risk. (3) More forgiving of small directional moves. Management: Close at 50% profit. Roll untested side if one side tested.

(4) Complex profit profile - max profit at strike at front expiration. Strike selection: Use ATM strike for maximum theta differential. Front month: 30 DTE or less. Back month: 60+ DTE. Management: Close before front-month expiration to avoid assignment risk. Adjust if underlying moves away from strike. McMillan warns: Calendars can be hurt by IV decrease or large underlying moves.

Max loss = Net debit paid. Very low cost but very specific price target. Breakevens = Lower strike + Debit, Upper strike - Debit. Iron butterfly alternative: Sell ATM straddle + Buy OTM strangle for protection. Same profit profile, often for credit instead of debit. Use cases: (1) Expecting pinning action near specific price.

Implications for short premium sellers: Negative gamma means losses accelerate as position moves against you. Near expiration, gamma spikes make short ATM options extremely risky. Risk management: (1) Close positions before final week to avoid gamma spike. (2) Use defined risk strategies (spreads) to cap gamma exposure. (3) Avoid ATM strikes when selling with <7 DTE.

Time decay curve: Options lose approximately 1/3 of value in first 2/3 of life, and 2/3 of value in final 1/3 of life. Practical implications: (1) Sell options 30-45 DTE to capture steepest decay. (2) Buy options with 60+ DTE to minimize theta burn. (3) Weekend theta: Friday positions decay through weekend. (4) Theta is not constant - recalculates daily based on current parameters.",

Trading implications: (1) Buy options when IV is low, sell when IV is high. (2) Calendars are long vega - benefit from IV increase. (3) Iron condors are short vega - benefit from IV contraction.

(2) Debit spreads: Close if value drops to 50% of entry. Example: Paid $2.00, close at $1.00. (3) Short strangles/straddles: Close if either side reaches 2x original credit. (4) Covered calls: Let assignment happen or close entire position (stock + call) if stock breaks key support. (5) General rule: Never let a losing trade become a catastrophic loss. Cut losses at predetermined levels. McMillan emphasizes: The mark of a professional is not avoiding losses, but controlling them. A 50% loss requires 100% gain to recover. A 20% loss only requires 25% gain.",

Strategies: (1) Sell volatility when IV Rank > 75% (expect contraction). (2) Buy volatility when IV Rank < 25% (expect expansion). (3) Calendar spreads profit from volatility term structure. (4) Variance swaps for pure volatility exposure. McMillan's observation: Selling volatility has positive expected value due to volatility risk premium, but occasional large losses.

Risk: Gap risk if move exceeds expected move. (2) BUY premium 2-3 weeks before earnings when IV is low. Sell before announcement to capture IV expansion without event risk. (3) POST-EARNINGS plays: Trade continuation or reversal patterns after initial reaction. McMillan caution: Earnings trading is not for beginners. Gaps can exceed expected move by 2-3x.

Early exercise scenarios: (1) Deep ITM calls before ex-dividend if dividend > time value. (2) Deep ITM puts when time value < interest on proceeds. (3) Never exercise OTM options (let them expire worthless). Assignment timing: Can occur anytime for American options but most common: (1) At expiration if ITM. (2) Before ex-dividend for ITM calls. (3) Randomly assigned by OCC among all short positions. Preparation: Always have plan for assignment. Keep adequate capital. Don't be caught off guard.",
