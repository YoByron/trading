Trading signals:\n\n- GSR > 80: Silver undervalued relative to gold. Overweight SLV vs GLD.\n- GSR < 50: Silver overvalued. Overweight GLD vs SLV.\n- GSR mean reversion: When GSR reaches extremes (>85 or <45), expect reversion within 6-18 months.\n\nKey insight: GSR tends to spike during crises (gold outperforms as safe haven), then mean-reverts as silver catches up during recovery.",

When inflation > Treasury yields, holding gold has no opportunity cost.\n- Real rates below -1%: Strong gold tailwind. 2020-2022 saw gold rally from $1500 to $2000+ with deeply negative real rates.\n- Real rates above +2%: BEARISH for gold. Bonds offer positive real return, reducing gold's appeal.\n\nMonitor: 10-Year TIPS yield (DFII10 on FRED) as proxy for real rates.",

Weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for foreign buyers.\n- DXY rising: BEARISH for gold. Stronger dollar creates headwind.\n- DXY breakdowns below 100: Often trigger gold rallies.\n\nException: During severe risk-off (2008, 2020 March), both dollar AND gold can rise as flight-to-safety assets.",

Consider reducing precious metals allocation.\n\nKey pattern: Silver underperforms gold during fear spikes, then outperforms during recovery. GSR expands in fear, contracts in recovery.",

If CPI surprises to upside, gold rallies. If inflation is already priced in, gold may lag.\n\nTriggers for gold as inflation hedge:\n- CPI prints above consensus\n- Fed behind the curve\n- Fiscal deficit expansion\n- Money supply (M2) growth",
