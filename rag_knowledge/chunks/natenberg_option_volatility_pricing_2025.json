      "content": "Historical volatility (HV) measures the actual price movement of an underlying asset over a past period, calculated as the annualized standard deviation of returns. It answers 'How much did the stock actually move?' Implied volatility (IV) is derived from option prices and represents the market's expectation of future volatility. It answers 'How much does the market expect the stock to move?' The critical insight is that IV is forward-looking while HV is backward-looking. When IV > HV, options are relatively expensive (market expects more movement than history suggests). When IV < HV, options are relatively cheap. Professional traders constantly compare these metrics. A stock with 20% HV but 35% IV presents a potential volatility selling opportunity - you can sell options at inflated prices. Conversely, 40% HV with 25% IV suggests buying options cheaply before the market reprices volatility higher. The relationship between HV and IV is mean-reverting over time, though the timeframe varies by underlying. Technology stocks often show higher IV due to event risk (earnings, product launches), while stable dividend-paying stocks show compressed IV ranges. Understanding this relationship is fundamental to all option strategies.",

      "content": "Volatility term structure shows how implied volatility varies across different expirations for the same underlying. Near-term options often have different IV than longer-dated options, creating a volatility curve. A 'normal' term structure slopes upward (longer-dated options have higher IV) because there's more uncertainty over longer periods. An inverted term structure (near-term IV > long-term IV) typically signals an imminent event: earnings in 2 weeks, FDA decision pending, election approaching. This inversion creates calendar spread opportunities. Volatility cones display historical volatility ranges across multiple timeframes (10-day HV, 20-day HV, 30-day HV, etc.) showing how volatility behaves at different measurement periods. By plotting current IV against the HV cone, traders identify rich or cheap options. If 30-day IV is at the 90th percentile of the 30-day HV cone, options are historically expensive. The cone reveals volatility clustering - high volatility periods tend to cluster together, as do low volatility periods. Professional traders use cones to set realistic expectations: if 20-day HV rarely exceeds 40%, selling options with 50% IV offers edge. The term structure and cone together provide a complete volatility framework.",

      "content": "Volatility exhibits mean-reverting behavior - periods of high volatility tend to revert to average levels, and periods of low volatility eventually expand. This is one of the most reliable phenomena in options trading. During market stress, VIX spikes to 40-80, but historically reverts to its long-term mean around 15-20 within weeks or months. Individual stock IVs behave similarly. The mean reversion principle underlies most premium selling strategies. When IV spikes, sell premium expecting reversion to mean. When IV is compressed, buy premium expecting expansion. The key is identifying the 'true mean' for each underlying - it varies significantly. SPY has a stable mean around 15-18% IV. Tech stocks might have means around 35-50%. Meme stocks have higher, more unstable means. The reversion speed also varies: broad market IV (VIX) reverts faster than individual stock IV. Small-cap IVs are stickier than large-cap. Earnings-driven spikes collapse immediately post-announcement. The practical edge comes from selling IV when it's 2+ standard deviations above its mean, and buying when it's 2+ standard deviations below.

Delta also approximates probability of finishing in-the-money: 0.30 delta ≈ 30% chance of expiring ITM. Call deltas range from 0 to 1.00; put deltas from 0 to -1.00. At-the-money (ATM) options have ~0.50 delta. Deep in-the-money (ITM) options approach 1.00 delta, behaving almost like stock. Far out-of-the-money (OTM) options have deltas near 0, moving minimally with stock price. Delta is the foundation of directional trading and hedging. A delta-neutral portfolio has zero directional exposure - gains from stock price moves are offset by option positions. Market makers maintain delta-neutral positions, profiting from volatility and time decay rather than directional bets. For retail traders, delta determines position sizing: 100 shares of stock = 1.00 delta per share = 100 total delta. One ATM call (~0.50 delta) = ~50 shares of stock exposure.

Long gamma positions (long options) benefit from large price swings in either direction because delta adjusts favorably.

Short gamma positions (short options) suffer from large moves because delta adjusts against you. This is why selling options is called 'picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.' Gamma scalping is a professional strategy: maintain delta-neutral position while long gamma, profit from volatility by continuously rehedging.

Theta accelerates as expiration approaches - weekly options decay faster than monthlies, which decay faster than LEAPS. The last 30 days see exponential theta decay, with the final week experiencing brutal erosion. ATM options have the highest theta in absolute dollar terms. Deep ITM options have minimal theta because they're mostly intrinsic value. OTM options have theta but less dollar impact. Theta is often called the option seller's edge - collect decay every day the market is closed, every weekend, every holiday. A 30-day ATM option with -$15 theta loses $15/day (all else equal). Over a weekend, 3 days of theta vanish. Premium sellers structure trades to maximize theta collection while managing other Greeks.

Long options are long vega (profit from IV increases). Short options are short vega (profit from IV decreases). ATM options have maximum vega. Longer-dated options have higher vega than near-term options because volatility has more time to impact price. This creates the foundation for calendar spreads: sell near-term low-vega options, buy long-term high-vega options, profit if IV expands. Vega is critical for earnings trades: IV typically inflates 2-3 weeks before earnings, then crashes immediately after (volatility crush). Buying options into earnings faces massive negative vega post-announcement even if you're directionally correct. Conversely, selling options into earnings captures inflated vega, profiting from the crush.

However, during Fed rate hiking/cutting cycles or for long-dated options (LEAPS), rho becomes material. Higher interest rates increase call values and decrease put values. Why? In Black-Scholes, buying a call is economically similar to buying stock on margin - you pay the option premium instead of borrowing to buy stock. Higher rates make this synthetic long stock position more attractive (you save more on interest costs), increasing call value. For puts, the reverse holds. Rho is proportional to time to expiration - LEAPS have significant rho while weekly options have negligible rho. In a rising rate environment, long-term call spreads benefit relative to put spreads. Professional traders mostly ignore rho for short-term trades but must account for it in long-term portfolios. The 2022-2023 Fed hiking cycle made rho relevant again after a decade of zero rates.

The model assumes at each time step, price moves up or down by fixed factors (u and d), creating a tree of possibilities. At expiration, option value is intrinsic value (max(S-K, 0) for calls). Working backward, at each node: option value = max(intrinsic value, expected discounted value from waiting). If intrinsic > expected, early exercise is optimal. Why early exercise matters: (1) Deep ITM puts may be exercised early to capture interest on proceeds rather than wait. (2) ITM calls may be exercised just before ex-dividend to capture the dividend rather than suffer the stock price drop. (3) During takeovers, calls on acquired companies may be exercised immediately.

In liquid markets, arbitrageurs enforce put-call parity to within bid-ask spreads. However, violations appear: (1) American options can violate due to early exercise value.

In equity markets, the skew is pronounced: 25-delta puts might have 20% higher IV than ATM. In currency markets, the smile is more symmetric. The skew creates trading opportunities: (1) Put vertical spreads are 'expensive' - buying OTM put costs more vega than selling further OTM put gains. (2) Put ratio spreads can exploit this - sell 2 OTM puts, buy 1 ATM put to be vega neutral. (3) Call vertical spreads are 'cheap' - selling OTM call gives up little vega compared to buying ATM call.

They profit in three scenarios: (1) Stock stays near strike - maximize theta differential. (2) Implied volatility increases - long option gains more than short loses. (3) Term structure flattens - if near-term IV drops relative to long-term. Ideal setup: sell during elevated IV (collect high premium on front month), buy back month when IV is normal. As front month decays and IV potentially contracts, the spread widens. Risk: large directional moves hurt calendars because they're vega-positive but gamma-negative.

(2) Theta exposure - if you're theta positive (premium seller), limit daily theta to amount you're willing to lose to volatility spike. Example: if portfolio collects $100/day theta, ensure you can withstand 5x reversal ($500 loss from vol spike). (3) Vega exposure - critical for volatility traders. Limit vega to percent of portfolio. Conservative: vega < 1% of account value per 1% IV change. (4) Gamma exposure - massive gamma (positive or negative) creates instability. Keep absolute gamma < 5% of delta. The key insight: normalize all positions to 'shares equivalent' using delta, then check that theta, vega, gamma are proportional to account size.

(3) Volatility is mean-reverting: The most reliable phenomenon in options markets. Trade the extremes - sell expensive volatility, buy cheap volatility. Be patient waiting for extremes. (4) Time is your enemy or friend: Long options fight time decay every day. Short options collect it. Choose strategies that align with your outlook on both direction AND time. (5) Know your Greeks: Before every trade, explicitly state your delta, gamma, theta, vega exposures. If you can't explain what you're betting on, don't place the bet.
