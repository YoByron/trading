      "content": "The Wheel Strategy is a systematic income approach cycling between cash-secured puts and covered calls. PHASE 1 - SELLING PUTS: Identify stock you want to own at lower price. Sell OTM put (delta 0.20-0.30) at support level. Collect premium while waiting for better entry. If assigned: Great - you bought stock at discount (strike - premium). If not assigned: Keep premium, repeat. PHASE 2 - COVERED CALLS: Once assigned, sell OTM call above cost basis. Strike should be above (stock purchase price - all premiums collected). If called away: Profit locked in, return to Phase 1. If not called: Keep premium, sell another call. CYCLE CONTINUES: Keep wheeling the same stock, collecting premium in both phases. Best candidates: High-quality dividend stocks with moderate volatility, liquid options, stable businesses you'd hold long-term anyway.",

      "content": "Risk management for the Wheel: (1) STOCK SELECTION: Only wheel stocks you genuinely want to own. Never wheel a stock just because premium is high. (2) STRIKE SELECTION: Put strike at technical support. Call strike above cost basis. (3) POSITION SIZING: Max 5% of portfolio in single wheel position. (4) ROLLING DOWN: If stock drops significantly after assignment, can sell puts at lower strike to accumulate more shares at better price. (5) NEVER ROLL INDEFINITELY: If thesis is broken, exit position. Don't hold a falling knife. (6) DIVIDEND CONSIDERATION: Ex-dividend dates can trigger early assignment on calls - plan accordingly. (7) AVOID EARNINGS: Don't have short options open through earnings if you're income-focused. Common mistake: Wheeling high-IV stocks that are fundamentally weak. Premium is high for a reason - the stock is risky.",

Sell short-term OTM call (delta 0.20-0.30, 30-45 DTE). Benefits: (1) Much lower capital requirement than traditional covered call. (2) Defined risk (max loss = LEAPS cost - premium collected). (3) Similar profit profile to covered call. (4) Can be deployed on expensive stocks. Management: (1) Roll short call monthly for ongoing income. (2) Roll LEAPS when it has 90-120 days remaining. (3) Close entire position if stock drops significantly. Risks: (1) LEAPS time decay if held too long. (2) Wide bid-ask spreads on LEAPS. (3) Assignment on short call before LEAPS expiration. Best for: Capital-efficient covered call alternative on expensive stocks.",

MANAGEMENT: (1) Take profit at 50% of max profit. (2) Close at 21 DTE regardless of P/L. (3) If one side tested (strike breached): Roll untested side closer to collect more credit. (4) If both sides threatened: Close position - wrong market read. ADJUSTMENT TECHNIQUES: (1) Roll up/down: Move entire spread to better centered position. (2) Add calendar: Buy back-month option to add vega and reduce delta. (3) Convert to broken wing butterfly: Shift strikes asymmetrically. (4) Close tested side, manage remaining side as credit spread. Key insight: Managing iron condors is more important than entry. Winners are made through good management, not perfect entries.",

Key: Total credit > call spread width = No upside risk! Profit zone: Between put strike and short call strike. Max loss: Put strike - Total credit (assignment risk only). Use when: Neutral to slightly bullish, want protection against upside blow-out. BIG LIZARD: Same as Jade Lizard but sell ATM call instead of OTM. Higher premium, more aggressive stance. Example Jade Lizard: Stock at $100. Sell $95 put for $1.50. Sell $105 call for $1.00. Buy $110 call for $0.40. Total credit = $2.10. Call spread width = $5. Since $2.10 < $5, there IS some upside risk ($5 - $2.10 = $2.90). To make 'riskless' upside: need tighter call spread or higher put premium.",

Profit profile: Unlimited profit if stock surges. Small profit/loss if stock stays flat. Max loss at long strike at expiration. PUT RATIO BACKSPREAD: Sell 1 ATM put. Buy 2 OTM puts. Unlimited profit if stock crashes. Use cases: (1) Pre-earnings when expecting large move but unsure of direction. (2) Takeover speculation. (3) FDA binary events. (4) Cheap lottery tickets with limited downside. Key advantage: Define your max loss (at the long strike), but have unlimited potential. Better risk/reward than long straddles in some cases. Timing: Best entered when IV is low - you're net long vega.",

(2) Profits from IV increase (long options have more vega). (3) Wide profit zone. (4) Defined risk. (5) Good for high-IV environments expecting volatility to persist. Management: Roll short options monthly for ongoing income. Keep long options as base until 60-90 DTE remaining, then roll them out. Risk: Large quick move can hurt position before time decay kicks in. Best for: Range-bound markets with elevated IV, patient traders.",

Profit profile: Profit from moderate rise (like bull spread). Profit if stock stays flat (from put premium). Risk: Assigned on put if stock falls significantly.

Use when: (1) Expecting pinning action but with directional bias. (2) Want wider profit zone than standard butterfly. (3) Playing support/resistance levels with room for upside. Variations: Can skip strikes on either side depending on directional bias. Skip-strike on upside = bullish. Skip-strike on downside = bearish. Advanced technique for experienced butterfly traders.",

(3) As stock moves down, delta becomes negative - buy stock to delta-hedge. (4) Each round trip captures profit if move is larger than theta decay. Profit condition: Realized volatility > Implied volatility. Loss condition: Stock stays flat (theta decay kills position). Frequency: Can hedge hourly, daily, or at price thresholds.

(2) VIX CALL SPREADS: Cheap hedge against market crashes (VIX spikes when market falls). (3) VXX COVERED CALLS: Own VXX, sell calls - captures contango decay. (4) CALENDAR SPREADS: Exploit VIX futures term structure. Risk warning: VIX products are complex and can move dramatically. VXX decays over time due to contango.

Own stock, buy OTM put (protection), sell OTM call (funds put). Zero cost if call premium = put premium. Profit: Capped at call strike. Protection: Losses limited below put strike.

Always worth exactly $10 at expiration (minus interest). Arbitrage: If box can be bought for < $10 PV, or sold for > $10 PV, there's arbitrage. Reality check: (1) Arbitrage opportunities are rare and small. (2) Transaction costs often eliminate profit. (3) Early assignment risk with American options. (4) Mainly used by market makers and institutions. Retail use: Occasionally used for tax strategies or synthetic lending. Not a trading strategy for profit - more of a structural tool.",
