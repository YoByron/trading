    "content": "Pekman urges the trader to treat AI as a personal coach: define your risk profile, let LLMs decode white papers and red flags, keep wallet/exchange hygiene in check, and let automation looks after rebalancing or risk guards while you design scenarios. Free AI tool reviews from 2025 validate the playbook—Pionex and Kryll deliver grid/arbitrage bots plus drag-and-drop strategies, 3Commas and Coinrule free tiers handle DCA and trailing-stop logic, and Stoic or Coinrule templates keep momentum without coding. The net effect: you spend time writing prompts, reviewing agentic outputs, and cross-checking them with on-chain data rather than staring at the ticker all day.",

    "content": "New investors must track trustworthy exchanges, segregate hot and cold wallets, and secure private keys because custodial breaches still cost more than volatility. Investopedia and Forbes both recommend dollar-cost averaging, modest allocations (roughly 1%–5% of the financial portfolio for speculation, 1%–7.5% for younger investors), and no leverage until you understand liquidity. Always verify withdrawal addresses, keep tax forms handy, and treat every new coin as utility or speculation using a simple checklist before adding it to the watchlist.",

The modern agentic crypto stack includes Claude-based assistants like Nansen AI, which cross-references on-chain flows, expert wallets, and social chatter before proposing trades, while also flagging hallucinations. The stewarding routine is: run GPT-4/Claude prompts to build scenario tables, simulate adverse moves, and outline when to scale into positions versus when to shelve them because of risk signals.",

Each strategy includes a red-flag checklist—avoid projects without clear utility, do not chase hype, and verify founding teams before committing capital. The philosophy is disciplined, multi-bucket investing that blends long-term core positions with smaller high-risk probes that offer learning value if monitored via AI-augmented dashboards.",
