What matters is executing a strategy with a statistical edge over hundreds of trades. The outcome of THIS trade is irrelevant - only the distribution of outcomes matters.",
      "application": "Don't second-guess a trade that goes against you. If your system has 55% win rate, you WILL lose 45 times per 100 trades. Each loss is not a mistake - it's statistics.",

Fear distorts perception and triggers fight-or-flight responses that override rational analysis.",

If you believe 'the market offers infinite opportunities', you'll see those instead. Winners have empowering beliefs about uncertainty.",
