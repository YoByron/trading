Calculates worst-case loss across all scenarios. Margin = Largest theoretical loss. (3) BENEFITS: Typically 50-75% lower margin than Reg-T for hedged positions. Offsets: Longs vs shorts, puts vs calls recognized. Correlation between positions considered. (4) REQUIREMENTS: Minimum $125,000 equity to open, $100,000 to maintain. Highest options approval level.

Weights options by strike to create variance swap replication. Formula: Interpolates near-term and next-term variance to constant 30-day maturity. Square root of variance = VIX. (3) INPUTS: SPX options with 23-37 days to expiration (near-term) and next monthly expiration (next-term). Only uses options with non-zero bid prices. Weights inversely proportional to strike squared (Δk/k²). (4) INTERPRETATION: VIX = 20 means market expects 20% annualized volatility over next 30 days. Daily expected move = VIX / √365 = 20 / 19.1 = ~1.05%. VIX >30 = high volatility/fear. VIX <15 = complacency. (5) IMPORTANT: VIX measures IMPLIED volatility, not realized volatility.

Backwardation = front-month lower than back months (fear/stress). (4) CONTANGO COST: VIX futures mean-revert to spot VIX. Contango = daily decay in long VIX positions. VXX and other VIX ETPs lose value in contango (~5-10% monthly). (5) TRADING STRATEGIES: Long VIX calls for tail risk hedge (uncorrelated to stocks). Short VIX calls for premium income (high risk).

As expiration approaches, delta hedging becomes aggressive. Large open interest at specific strike creates buying/selling pressure pushing stock toward that strike. Stock may settle exactly at strike or oscillate around it. (3) ASSIGNMENT UNCERTAINTY: Stock closes at $50.00, you're short $50 calls. Are you assigned?

Example: Bid $2.00, Ask $2.20 = $0.20 spread (10% of mid-price). Wide spreads = high transaction cost. CBOE rule of thumb: Spread should be <5-10% of option price for good liquidity. (3) FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY: Underlying popularity (SPY very liquid, small-caps illiquid). Strike selection (ATM most liquid, deep ITM/OTM less liquid). Expiration date (near-term most liquid, LEAPs less liquid). Time of day (open/close most liquid, mid-day less). Market conditions (volatility spikes reduce liquidity). (4) LIQUIDITY RISKS: Wide spreads increase cost to enter/exit. Market orders can execute at terrible prices. May not be able to exit position at fair value.

Portfolio delta = sum of all position deltas (measures directional risk). (2) GAMMA: Rate of change of delta relative to $1 change in underlying. Highest for ATM options near expiration. Long options = positive gamma (delta increases as stock moves favorably). Short options = negative gamma (delta works against you). Gamma risk increases dramatically in final week. (3) THETA: Rate of option value decay per day (time decay). Always negative for long options (you lose value each day). Always positive for short options (you gain value each day). Accelerates near expiration (non-linear). ATM options have highest theta. (4) VEGA: Change in option value per 1% change in implied volatility. Long options = positive vega (benefit from IV increase). Short options = negative vega (hurt by IV increase). Higher for longer-dated options. ATM options have highest vega.

Uses Black-Scholes model in reverse: Input option price → Solve for volatility. NOT a prediction of direction, only magnitude of expected moves. (2) IV vs HISTORICAL VOLATILITY: Historical Volatility (HV) = actual past price movement (standard deviation of returns). IV often differs from HV (forward-looking vs backward-looking). IV typically HIGHER than HV (volatility risk premium). (3) IV PERCENTILE/RANK: IV Rank = (Current IV - 52-week IV low) / (52-week IV high - 52-week IV low) x 100. IV Percentile = percentage of days in past year IV was below current IV. High IV Rank (>50) = expensive options, favor selling premium. Low IV Rank (<50) = cheap options, favor buying options. (4) VOLATILITY SMILE/SKEW: OTM puts typically have higher IV than ATM/OTM calls (fear of downside). Creates volatility skew on chart. Reflects crash risk premium and supply/demand imbalance. (5) VIX RELATIONSHIP: VIX measures SPX implied volatility (30-day weighted). High VIX (>30) = high SPX option IV = option premium expensive. Low VIX (<15) = low SPX option IV = option premium cheap.

      "content": "CBOE Option Value Breakdown: (1) TOTAL OPTION PREMIUM = Intrinsic Value + Extrinsic Value (Time Value). (2) INTRINSIC VALUE: The amount option is in-the-money. Calls: Intrinsic = MAX(Stock Price - Strike Price, 0). Puts: Intrinsic = MAX(Strike Price - Stock Price, 0). Example: $100 stock, $95 call = $5 intrinsic value. Example: $100 stock, $105 put = $5 intrinsic value. ATM and OTM options have ZERO intrinsic value. (3) EXTRINSIC VALUE (TIME VALUE): Premium above intrinsic value. Represents time until expiration + volatility expectations. Formula: Extrinsic = Option Price - Intrinsic Value. Example: $100 stock, $95 call trading at $7 = $5 intrinsic + $2 extrinsic. Factors affecting extrinsic: Time to expiration (more time = more value), Implied volatility (higher IV = more value), Interest rates (minor impact), Dividends (affects call value). (4) TIME DECAY: Extrinsic value decays to $0 at expiration (theta decay). Decay accelerates in final 30 days (non-linear). ATM options have maximum extrinsic value. Deep ITM options mostly intrinsic, minimal extrinsic. Deep OTM options entirely extrinsic (high risk of total loss). (5) CBOE PRINCIPLE: Never pay high extrinsic value for deep ITM options - you're overpaying for time. At expiration, all options worth exactly their intrinsic value (extrinsic = $0).",

      "topic": "Moneyness - In/At/Out of the Money Definitions",
      "content": "CBOE Moneyness Classifications: (1) IN-THE-MONEY (ITM): Option has intrinsic value. Calls: Stock price > Strike price. Puts: Stock price < Strike price. Example: $100 stock, $95 call is $5 ITM. Example: $100 stock, $105 put is $5 ITM. Higher probability of expiring profitable (delta >0.50 for calls). Higher premium than ATM/OTM. More sensitive to stock movement (higher delta). (2) AT-THE-MONEY (ATM): Strike price equals (or very close to) stock price. Highest extrinsic value. Delta approximately 0.50 (50% probability of expiring ITM). Maximum gamma (delta changes fastest). Most liquid strike typically. Highest time decay in absolute dollar terms. (3) OUT-OF-THE-MONEY (OTM): No intrinsic value - premium is all extrinsic. Calls: Stock price < Strike price. Puts: Stock price > Strike price. Example: $100 stock, $105 call is OTM. Example: $100 stock, $95 put is OTM. Lower premium (cheaper to buy). Lower probability of profit (delta <0.50). Higher risk of 100% loss (expires worthless). (4) DEEP IN-THE-MONEY: Multiple strikes in the money (typically 10%+ difference). Delta approaches 1.00 (moves nearly $1 for $1 with stock). High probability of expiring ITM (>80%). Mostly intrinsic value, minimal time value. (5) CBOE TRADING IMPLICATIONS: Buyers: ITM = conservative (higher probability, higher cost). ATM = balanced. OTM = speculative (lower probability, lower cost). Sellers: OTM = highest probability of profit. ATM = highest premium collection. ITM = highest assignment risk.",

      "topic": "Time-Duration Order Types - GTC, Day, FOK, IOC",
      "content": "CBOE Time-In-Force Instructions: (1) DAY ORDER: Order valid only for current trading day. Automatically cancelled if not filled by market close (4:00 PM ET equity, 4:15 PM ET index). Default order type on most platforms. Prevents stale orders carrying over to next day. CBOE recommendation: Use for short-term tactical trades. (2) GOOD-TIL-CANCELED (GTC): Order remains active until filled or manually cancelled (up to 90 days typically). Does NOT automatically cancel at end of trading day. Survives overnight and multi-day. Broker typically cancels after 30-90 days (varies by firm). Risk: May execute at unfavorable price days later if forgotten. CBOE caution: Monitor GTC orders daily - cancel if no longer wanted. (3) FILL-OR-KILL (FOK): Order must be filled IMMEDIATELY in its entirety or cancelled. No partial fills accepted. Used when you need full size instantly or not at all. Rare in options due to size fragmentation. Best for highly liquid options during active hours. (4) IMMEDIATE-OR-CANCEL (IOC): Order executed immediately for available quantity, unfilled portion cancelled. Accepts partial fills. Example: Order 10 contracts, 7 fill immediately, 3 cancelled. Useful for large orders in less liquid options. More common than FOK. (5) ALL-OR-NONE (AON): Order must be filled completely or not at all, but does NOT require immediate execution. Can rest in book until full size available. Less common in options trading. (6) CBOE BEST PRACTICE: Day orders for active trading. GTC for patient limit orders (but monitor daily). Avoid FOK/IOC unless you understand execution priorities. Most retail traders should stick with Day and GTC orders.",

      "topic": "Position and Exercise Limits - Regulatory Caps",
      "content": "CBOE/FINRA Position Limit Rules: (1) DEFINITION: Maximum number of option contracts (same side of market, same underlying) an investor can hold. Applies to all accounts controlled by same entity (aggregated). Purpose: Prevent market manipulation and concentration risk. (2) POSITION LIMITS BY TIER: Tier 1 (Largest, most liquid): 250,000 contracts (AAPL, SPY, QQQ, etc.). Tier 2: 200,000 contracts. Tier 3: 75,000 contracts. Tier 4: 50,000 contracts. Tier 5 (Smallest, least liquid): 25,000 contracts. Index options: Higher limits (SPX = 500,000 contracts for large indexes). (3) SAME SIDE OF MARKET: Long calls + Short puts = Same side (bullish). Long puts + Short calls = Same side (bearish). Example: Cannot hold 250,000 AAPL long calls + 1 short put if limit is 250,000. Must aggregate across accounts at all brokers. (4) EXERCISE LIMITS: Cannot exercise more than position limit in any 5 consecutive business days. Same limits as position limits. Prevents using exercise to circumvent position limits. (5) CBOE EXEMPTIONS: Market makers and specialists may get exemptions for bona fide hedging. Broker-dealers with regulatory approval. Institutional hedging exemptions possible (case-by-case). (6) VIOLATIONS: Fines from FINRA/CBOE. Forced liquidation of excess positions. Suspension from options trading. Account restrictions. (7) CBOE GUIDANCE: Check position limits before large trades (available on CBOE website). Retail traders rarely approach limits. Institutional traders must monitor actively. Hedge funds aggregating multiple accounts must track carefully.",

      "topic": "Dividend Risk for Call Sellers - Early Assignment",
      "content": "CBOE Dividend Risk Framework: (1) EARLY ASSIGNMENT RISK: American-style call options on dividend-paying stocks face early exercise risk. Highest risk: Day before ex-dividend date. Call holders may exercise early to capture dividend. Especially if: Dividend > Remaining time value in option. (2) EX-DIVIDEND MECHANICS: Ex-dividend date = first day stock trades without dividend. Stock drops by ~dividend amount at open on ex-dividend day. Example: $100 stock, $0.50 dividend → Opens ~$99.50 on ex-div date. Call holder wants to own stock BEFORE ex-div to receive dividend. Must exercise day before ex-dividend (to settle before ex-div). (3) DECISION ANALYSIS: Compare dividend vs option time value. If dividend ($0.50) > time value ($0.20), exercise is optimal. Call holder: Exercise → Receive $0.50 dividend, Give up $0.20 time value, Net gain $0.30. Call seller: Gets assigned, Must deliver stock (buy at market if naked). (4) ITM CALLS AT HIGHEST RISK: Deep ITM calls (delta ~1.00) have minimal time value. Almost certain to be exercised if dividend > time value. ATM/OTM calls rarely exercised early (too much time value). (5) CBOE MITIGATION STRATEGIES: Close short call positions before ex-dividend if ITM. Roll to later expiration or higher strike. Use European-style index options (no early exercise). Sell puts instead of calls on dividend-paying stocks (puts never exercised early for dividends). Sell covered calls (assignment not a problem - own stock already). (6) CBOE MONITORING: Check ex-dividend dates for all stocks with short calls. Brokers typically send warnings for high-risk positions. Most assignment occurs after 6 PM ET on day before ex-div. Position assigned overnight - cannot prevent once notified.",

      "content": "CBOE/OCC Corporate Actions Protocol: (1) STANDARD ADJUSTMENTS: Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) adjusts option contracts for certain corporate actions. Goal: Maintain economic equivalence before/after corporate action. Not all events trigger adjustments. (2) STOCK SPLITS: 2-for-1 split example: 1 contract of $100 strike → 2 contracts of $50 strike. Contract multiplier remains 100 shares per contract (now 200 shares total). Option symbol changes to non-standard symbol. (3) REVERSE SPLITS: 1-for-10 reverse split example: 10 contracts of $10 strike → 1 contract of $100 strike. Deliverable changes to 10 shares (not standard 100). Contract multiplier adjusted. Creates non-standard contracts (less liquid). (4) STOCK DIVIDENDS: 5% stock dividend: 1 contract now delivers 105 shares. Strike adjusted to maintain value: $100 strike → $95.24 strike ($100 / 1.05). Creates non-standard contract. (5) SPIN-OFFS: Parent company spins off subsidiary. Options deliver parent shares + spun-off subsidiary shares. Example: XYZ spins off ABC at $10/share ratio. 1 XYZ call delivers 100 XYZ shares + proportional ABC shares. Complex valuation - track both components. (6) MERGERS/ACQUISITIONS: Cash merger: Options settle for cash value at merger price. Stock merger: Options deliver acquirer's stock (may be fractional shares). Cash + stock merger: Delivers combination. (7) NON-ADJUSTED EVENTS: Regular cash dividends: NO adjustment (stock drops, options unaffected). Special dividends: May trigger adjustment if >10% of stock value. Stock buybacks: NO adjustment. (8) CBOE WARNINGS: Non-standard contracts become illiquid (wider spreads). Early close-out recommended before corporate action. Check OCC memos for adjustment details (available at theocc.com/memo). Brokers send notifications, but you're responsible for monitoring.",
