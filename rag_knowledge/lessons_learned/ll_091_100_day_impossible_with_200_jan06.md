# Lesson Learned #091: $100/day North Star Impossible with $200 Capital (Jan 6, 2026)

**ID**: LL-091
**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: financial-math, expectations, capital-requirements

## What Happened

CEO asked: "Are we going to reach our North Star at $100/day when we have $200 in our brokerage account?"

## The Math

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capital | $200 |
| Target | $100/day |
| Required Return | **50%/day** |

**This is mathematically impossible.**

Even the best hedge funds in history average 20-30% **per year**, not per day.

## Realistic Options Income

With cash-secured puts (our primary strategy):
- Monthly premium: 2-4% of capital secured
- With $200: Can secure 1 contract on ~$20 stock
- Realistic daily income: **$0.30-$1.00** (NOT $100)

## Capital Requirements for $100/day

| Strategy | Required Capital |
|----------|------------------|
| Conservative (2% monthly) | $150,000 |
| Aggressive (1% weekly) | $70,000 |
| Very Aggressive (2% weekly) | $35,000 |

## Scaled North Star Targets

| Capital Range | Realistic Daily Target |
|---------------|----------------------|
| $200-$1,000 | $1-$5/day |
| $1,000-$5,000 | $5-$25/day |
| $5,000-$50,000 | $25-$250/day |
| $50,000+ | $100+/day achievable |

## Action Required

1. Update system_state.json with phase-based targets
2. Don't set unrealistic expectations
3. Focus on **percentage returns** not dollar amounts
4. Scale targets as capital grows

## Key Insight

**Dollar targets must scale with capital.** A 1% weekly return is excellent, but 1% of $200 = $2, not $100.
