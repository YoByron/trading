## Core Philosophy

> "What's the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

## The Six Lies of Trading System Development

### Lie 1: Everything Matters Equally
**Reality**: Not all features contribute equally to profitability.
- Mental toughness coach: 0 interventions logged
- RAG system: 1,112 docs, 0 vectors working
- ML models: 0% of trading decisions
- **Rule-based momentum**: 100% of actual trades

### Lie 2: Multitasking Works
**Reality**: Building 5 agent frameworks (LangChain, DeepAgents, ADK, DiscoRL, SB3) simultaneously = none working well.
**Fix**: Pick ONE framework, make it work, then expand.

### Lie 3: A Disciplined Life
**Reality**: We don't need discipline for everything - just discipline for the ONE Thing.
**For trading**: Discipline to execute ONE profitable strategy consistently.

### Lie 4: Willpower Is Always on Will-Call
**Reality**: Willpower depletes. Automate the ONE Thing so it doesn't require willpower.
**For trading**: Automate the winning strategy, not the losing experiments.

### Lie 5: A Balanced Life
**Reality**: Extraordinary results require unbalanced focus.
**For trading**: Focus 80% effort on the 20% that produces results (Pareto).

### Lie 6: Big Is Bad
**Reality**: Think big, but act small - one domino at a time.
**For trading**: $100/day goal is big. ONE profitable trade per day is the domino.

## The Focusing Question Applied to Trading

### For the Trading System:
> "What's the ONE Thing I can do for my trading system such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

**Answer**: **Make the momentum strategy profitable first.**

Not:
- Build more ML models
- Add more RAG documents
- Implement more agent frameworks
- Create more dashboards

### Success List (Not To-Do List)

Priority order for our trading system:

1. **THE ONE THING**: Improve momentum strategy win rate from 38-52% to >55%
2. Everything else waits

## 80/20 Analysis of Our System

### The 20% That Matters:
- Entry/exit signal accuracy
- Position sizing
- Risk management (stop losses)

### The 80% That's Noise:
- Mental toughness coach (0 interventions)
- RAG retrieval (broken vectors)
- DiscoRL (15% weight, 0 validated trades)
- Bull/bear debate agents
- Multiple broker failovers
- Fancy dashboards

## Sequential Success Path

1. **Week 1**: Fix momentum strategy signals
2. **Week 2**: Validate with paper trades
3. **Week 3**: Achieve >55% win rate
4. **Week 4**: THEN consider ML enhancement
5. **Month 2**: THEN add complexity

## Key Quotes for Trading

- "Success is sequential, not simultaneous."
- "When you try to do too much, you end up accomplishing too little."
- "Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus."

## Applied Wisdom

### Before Adding Any Feature, Ask:
> "Does this directly improve my win rate or P/L?"

If NO, don't add it. If MAYBE, don't add it. Only if DEFINITELY YES.

### Current Status (Dec 2025):
- Win Rate: 0% (0 closed trades)
- P/L: $17.49 (0.017%)
- Status: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT

### The ONE Thing for Tomorrow:
Close a profitable trade. Just one.
