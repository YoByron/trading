# LL-195: SOFI Loss Realized - Jan 14, 2026

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Date**: 2026-01-14
**P/L Impact**: -$65.58 daily, -$40.74 total

## What Happened
1. SOFI stock + CSP opened Day 74 (Jan 13)
2. Position crossed Jan 30 earnings blackout
3. Emergency closed Day 76 (Jan 14)
4. Realized $65.58 loss

## Root Cause
- Earnings blackout was 7 days, should be 30 days
- No daily position scanner existed
- System allowed trade despite CLAUDE.md saying AVOID SOFI

## Fixes Applied
1. Extended blackout to 30 days (trade_gateway.py)
2. Created daily-earnings-check.yml workflow
3. Updated dashboard with honest P/L

## Lesson
Phil Town Rule #1 violated. The $65 loss was BETTER than holding through earnings where IV crush could cause $200+ loss. But the position should NEVER have been opened.
