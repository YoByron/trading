## Current Status

| Account | Balance | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Paper Trading | $4,959.26 | -0.81% P/L, Day 76/90 |
| Live Brokerage | $60.00 | Accumulation phase |
| Daily Deposits | $25/day | ~$750/month, ~$9,000/year |

## North Star Goal Analysis

**Goal**: $100/day passive income = $36,500/year

### The Hard Math Truth

From a $5,000 account, $100/day requires:
- Annual return needed: **730%** (UNREALISTIC)
- This is NOT achievable through any legitimate strategy

### What Capital Is Actually Needed?

Based on research from Option Alpha, Johnny Africa, and Early Retirement Now:

| Strategy | Realistic Return | Capital for $100/day |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Wheel Strategy | 15-30% | $120,000 - $240,000 |
| Credit Spreads | 30-50% | $75,000 - $120,000 |
| Covered Calls | 15-25% | $150,000 - $240,000 |

**Conservative estimate**: Need **$75,000-$100,000** to safely generate $100/day.

## Realistic Timeline with Daily Deposits

### Assumptions:
- Starting capital: $5,000 (paper → live transition)
- Daily deposits: $25/day (~$9,000/year)
- Target return: 25-30% annual (aggressive but achievable with credit spreads)

### Year-by-Year Projection (25% return):

| Year | Start | Deposits | Returns | End Balance | Daily Income |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2026 | $5,000 | $9,000 | $2,500 | $16,500 | ~$11/day |
| 2027 | $16,500 | $9,000 | $4,900 | $30,400 | ~$21/day |
| 2028 | $30,400 | $9,000 | $8,350 | $47,750 | ~$33/day |
| 2029 | $47,750 | $9,000 | $12,500 | $69,250 | ~$48/day |
| 2030 | $69,250 | $9,000 | $17,600 | $95,850 | ~$66/day |
| 2031 | $95,850 | $9,000 | $24,200 | $129,050 | ~$89/day |
| **2032** | $129,050 | $9,000 | $32,750 | **$170,800** | **$117/day** |

**Timeline to $100/day: ~6 years** (with 25% annual returns)

### Aggressive Scenario (35% return):

| Year | End Balance | Daily Income |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 2026 | $18,400 | ~$18/day |
| 2027 | $34,800 | ~$33/day |
| 2028 | $56,000 | ~$54/day |
| 2029 | $85,000 | ~$81/day |
| **2030** | **$123,750** | **$118/day** |

**Aggressive timeline: ~4-5 years** (with 35% returns)

## Optimal Strategy for Each Phase

### Phase 1: $5K-$15K (Current → End 2026)
- **Focus**: Credit spreads on SPY/IWM
- **Position size**: 2% risk per trade ($100-300)
- **Target**: 3-4% monthly (36-48% annual)
- **DCA**: Continue $25/day deposits into VOO

### Phase 2: $15K-$40K (2027-2028)
- **Focus**: Credit spreads + begin wheel on affordable stocks
- **Affordable tickers**: F ($10), SOFI ($15), T ($20), INTC ($20)
- **Position size**: 2-3% risk per trade
- **Target**: 25-35% annual

### Phase 3: $40K-$75K (2029-2030)
- **Focus**: Full wheel strategy capability
- **Tickers**: Add BAC, VZ, C, KO
- **Position size**: 2% risk per trade
- **Target**: 20-30% annual (more conservative as account grows)

### Phase 4: $75K+ (2031+)
- **Focus**: Consistent $100/day income
- **Strategy**: Diversified wheel across 5-10 positions
- **Risk management**: Never more than 10% in single position

## Key Insights from Research

### DCA is Your Friend
> "The key to successful investing is not timing the market but time in the market."

Your $25/day deposits will contribute **$9,000/year** regardless of market conditions. Over 6 years, that's **$54,000** in pure deposits alone.

### Credit Spreads > CSPs for Small Accounts
Credit spreads are more capital-efficient:
- CSP on $50 stock needs $5,000 collateral
- Credit spread on SPY needs $500-1,000 collateral
- Similar premium potential, less capital tied up

### Compounding is Exponential
Year 1-3: Slow growth (deposits > returns)
Year 4+: Fast growth (returns > deposits)

This is why consistency matters more than home runs.

## Updated CLAUDE.md Strategy Alignment

Current strategy in CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ Credit spreads on SPY/IWM (correct for Phase 1)
- ✅ 5% max position size (consider reducing to 2%)
- ✅ 90-day paper trading (validation phase)
- ✅ Target 3-5% monthly ($150-250) - realistic

**Recommendation**: Update target expectations:
- Short term (2026): $150-250/month (~$5-8/day)
- Medium term (2028): $500-1,000/month (~$17-33/day)
- Long term (2032): $3,000+/month ($100+/day)

## Action Items

1. **Continue 90-day paper trading** - validate strategy
2. **Maintain $25/day deposits** - this is the foundation
3. **Focus on credit spreads** - capital efficient for Phase 1
4. **Track every trade** - build data for optimization
5. **Review annually** - adjust timeline based on actual returns

**$100/day in 6 years is achievable** with:
- Consistent $25/day deposits ($54K total)
- 25-30% annual returns through credit spreads/wheel
- Patience and discipline
- NOT trying to get rich quick

The math works. Trust the process.
