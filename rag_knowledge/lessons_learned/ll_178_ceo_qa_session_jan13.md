# LL-178: CEO Q&A Session - Operational Gaps Identified

**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Session:** 7

## Key Findings

### What's Working:
- Rule #1: We're profitable today (+$9.62)
- Put closed with +$11 profit
- 618 tests passing
- 26 RAG lessons recorded

### Operational Gaps:
1. **RAG is passive** - not actively queried via Vertex AI API before tasks
2. **Blog is stale** - 2 posts, last updated Dec 2025
3. **Stop-loss not automated** - manual intervention required
4. **Buying power underutilized** - $78 of $5,000

### Root Cause of Slow Progress:
- Capital tied up in single position
- No automated entry signals
- Manual workflow triggers

### Action Taken:
- Closed put position (freed ~$4,800 collateral)
- Triggered daily-trading workflow for new CSP

## Path to $100/day North Star:
1. Deploy more capital (multiple CSPs)
2. Automate entry signals
3. Implement automated stop-loss
4. Active RAG querying before each task

## CEO Directives Reinforced:
- Never argue
- Always show evidence
- Query RAG before tasks
- Record every lesson
- Never tell CEO to do manual work
