## Summary

Analysis of 71,417 iron condor trades on SPY (2007-2017) reveals optimal management strategies.

## Study Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Underlying | SPY |
| Period | Jan 2007 - Mar 2017 |
| Total trades | 71,417 |
| Setup 1 | 16-delta short / 5-delta long (40,868 trades) |
| Setup 2 | 30-delta short / 16-delta long (30,549 trades) |

## Key Findings

### 1. Optimal Profit-Taking by Delta

| Delta Setup | Optimal Profit Target | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **16-delta (wide)** | **50-75%** | Higher win rate, more efficient capital use |
| 30-delta (tight) | 25-50% | Faster profit capture needed |

### 2. Win Rate by Profit Target

| Profit Target | Win Rate | Avg Days Held |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 25% | ~92% | ~8 days |
| 50% | ~85% | ~14 days |
| 75% | ~75% | ~25 days |
| Expiration | ~68% | ~45 days |

**Key insight**: Closing at 50% captures most profit in ~40% of the time.

### 3. Commission-Adjusted Performance

When accounting for $1/contract commissions:
- **16-delta condors**: 50-75% profit targets optimal
- **30-delta condors**: 25-50% profit targets optimal

### 4. VIX Impact on Returns

| VIX Level | 30-Delta Performance |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Low (< 15) | Below average |
| Medium (15-20) | Average |
| **High (> 20)** | **Significantly above average** |

**Trading 30-delta iron condors during high VIX environments substantially outperformed** other volatility regimes.

## Practical Application for Our Strategy

### Our Setup
- **Delta**: 15-20 (between study's 16 and 30)
- **Wings**: $5 wide
- **DTE**: 30-45 days

### Recommended Management (Based on Study)

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Hit 50% profit | **CLOSE** |
| 7 DTE reached | **CLOSE** (regardless of P/L) |
| 200% loss | **CLOSE** (stop-loss) |
| Tested side at 25+ delta | Consider adjustment |

### Expected Performance (Based on Study)

| Metric | 16-Delta Condors | Our 15-20 Delta |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Win rate (50% target) | ~85% | ~86% expected |
| Avg profit (per $5 wide) | ~$75-100 | ~$75-100 |
| Avg loss (per trade) | ~$200-250 | ~$200-250 |
| Profit factor | ~1.5 | ~1.5 expected |

## Risk-Reward Math

**Why 50% profit target matters:**

Traditional iron condor risk:reward ≈ 3:1 (risk $300 to make $100)

If letting trades expire:
- Need 75%+ win rate just to break even
- One loss = 3-4 winners needed to recover

With 50% profit target:
- Risk:reward improves to ~1.5:1
- Faster capital turnover
- More forgiving of occasional losses

## The 50% / 50% Rule

Study supports using:
- **50% profit target** (take profits)
- **50% stop-loss** (or 200% of credit)

This transforms the asymmetric risk into a more balanced trade.

## Capital Efficiency

| Strategy | Trades/Month | Capital Turns/Year |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Hold to expiration | 1 | 12 |
| **50% profit target** | **2-3** | **24-36** |

More frequent trades = more opportunities to compound.

## Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Set 50% profit alert when entering trade
2. [ ] Set 7 DTE reminder (mandatory close)
3. [ ] Set 200% loss stop-loss
4. [ ] Track actual vs expected win rate
5. [ ] Review after 30 trades for adjustment
