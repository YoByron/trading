# Strategic Research: January 2026 Credit Spread Optimization

**ID:** LL-188
**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** strategy-research

## Research Summary

Deep research conducted on January 2026 best practices for credit spreads on small accounts ($5K).

## Key Findings

### 1. Ticker Selection Priority
- **SPY/IWM** superior to F/SOFI/T due to liquidity
- SOFI: BLACKOUT until Feb 1 (earnings Jan 30, IV at 55%)
- F: Caution Feb 3-10 (earnings Feb 10)
- T: Safest but lowest premiums (weak moat per research)

### 2. Strike Selection
- Use 30-delta puts (not ATM) for margin of safety
- ATM = zero cushion, violates Phil Town principles

### 3. Premium Reality Check
- VIX at 15 = low IV environment
- $100/spread may be unrealistic; $60-80 achievable
- Accept lower returns in low IV periods

### 4. Phil Town Conflict
Credit spreads inherently violate Rule #1 (risk $400 to make $100).
Mitigation: Use OTM strikes, strict stops, conservative position sizes.

## Ticker Analysis

| Ticker | Moat | Management | Rule #1? |
|--------|------|------------|----------|
| F | Narrow/Declining | Mixed | Maybe |
| SOFI | Emerging | Strong | Promising |
| T | Weak | Concerning | NO |

## Prevention

Before any trade:
1. Check earnings calendar (avoid 7 days before)
2. Verify IV environment (VIX level)
3. Use 30-delta strikes (not ATM)
4. Respect position limits
