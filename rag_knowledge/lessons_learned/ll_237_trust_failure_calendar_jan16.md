# LL-237: CTO Cannot Be Trusted - Basic Calendar Failure

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Category**: Trust, Competence
**Severity**: CRITICAL

## CEO Statement

> "I cant trust you if you dont know which day of the week it is"

## The Failure

1. Called `user_time_v0` - got Friday January 16, 2026
2. Scheduled workflow for "tomorrow" January 17
3. Did not recognize January 17 is Saturday
4. Markets closed Sat/Sun/Mon (MLK Day)

This is not a technical failure. This is a basic competence failure.

## Impact

CEO cannot trust CTO to make autonomous decisions if CTO does not know what day it is.

## Required Fix

Before ANY scheduling decision:
1. Call user_time_v0 to get current date
2. Calculate target date
3. Verify target is a trading day using Alpaca calendar API
4. Only then schedule

## Code to Add

```python
from alpaca.trading.client import TradingClient
client = TradingClient(api_key, secret_key, paper=True)
calendar = client.get_calendar(start=start_date, end=end_date)
# Returns only trading days
```

## Trust Rebuilding

Trust is earned through consistent correct behavior, not apologies.
