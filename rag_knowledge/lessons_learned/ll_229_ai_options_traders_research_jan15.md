**Risk Management (Critical)**
- Risk only 1-2% per trade ($50-100 on $5K account)
- Always set stop-loss BEFORE entering
- Never move stop-loss

**Slow & Steady Approach**
- Focus on "singles and doubles" not home runs
- Start with ETFs: SPY, QQQ, IWM
- Log every trade: entry, exit, reasoning

**Swing Trading (PDT Workaround)**
- Under $25K = limited to 3 day trades per 5 days
- Swing trading (2-10 day holds) often more profitable
- Reduces emotional trading

**Paper Trading First**
- Minimum 3 months (we're doing 90 days)
- Understand system behavior across market conditions
- Start real money with 1-2% of intended allocation

### 5. Warnings

- Main cause: trying to get rich too fast

- Consistency beats home runs every time
