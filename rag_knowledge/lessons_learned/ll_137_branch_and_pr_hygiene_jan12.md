# Lesson Learned: Branch and PR Hygiene Protocol (LL-137)

**Date**: January 12, 2026
**Category**: DevOps / Git Workflow
**Severity**: Medium

## Context
CEO requested full branch and PR cleanup. Found 4 stale branches that were diverged from main.

## Discovery
- Branch `claude/fix-github-pages-lessons-EYCIW`: 72 commits behind, changes superseded
- Branch `claude/add-ai-lecture-resources-6Ms8a`: 15 commits behind, diverged
- Branch `claude/analyze-investment-strategy-0tAaZ`: 10 commits behind, diverged
- Branch `claude/research-constitutional-classifiers-eSLLA`: 15 commits behind, diverged

## Root Cause
Branches created for specific tasks were not cleaned up after work was completed or superseded.

## Solution
1. Check all branches for divergence from main
2. Delete branches that are significantly behind (>5 commits) with no unique value
3. Merge or cherry-pick any valuable changes before deletion
4. Always delete merged branches immediately

## Prevention
- Add post-merge hook to delete source branch
- Run weekly branch cleanup via scheduled workflow
- Set branch protection rules to auto-delete merged branches

## Evidence
```
Deleted: claude/fix-github-pages-lessons-EYCIW (72 behind)
Deleted: claude/add-ai-lecture-resources-6Ms8a (15 behind)
Deleted: claude/analyze-investment-strategy-0tAaZ (10 behind)
Deleted: claude/research-constitutional-classifiers-eSLLA (15 behind)
Remaining: main only
