# LL-191: SOFI Position Held Through Earnings Blackout

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Category**: Risk Management

## What Happened
SOFI CSP (Feb 6 expiration) was held despite Jan 30 earnings date approaching.
CLAUDE.md explicitly states "AVOID SOFI until Feb 1" but position was not closed.

## Impact
- Put option loss: -$13.00
- Total portfolio P/L: -$34.91 (-0.70%)
- Daily change: -$59.75

## Root Cause
1. Earnings blackout started Jan 23 (only 7 days before earnings)
2. SOFI position was opened BEFORE blackout period began
3. System checked NEW trades but not EXISTING positions

## Fix Applied
1. Extended earnings blackout from 7 to 30 days before earnings
2. Created scripts/emergency_close_sofi.py for immediate position exit
3. SOFI blackout now: Dec 30, 2025 - Feb 1, 2026

## Lesson Learned
Always verify EXISTING positions against upcoming earnings, not just NEW trades.
The system must proactively close positions that will cross earnings dates.
