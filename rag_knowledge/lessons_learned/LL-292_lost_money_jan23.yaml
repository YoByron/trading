title: "Lost $22.61 on Jan 23, 2026 - Iron Condor Execution Failure"
date: "2026-01-23"
severity: critical
status: unresolved

root_causes:
  - "Option expiration calculated for Sunday (Feb 22) instead of Friday"
  - "SPY options only expire on Fridays - asset not found errors"
  - "20+ workflow triggers but Friday fix didn't execute in time"
  - "Spent hours on credential debugging when real issue was expiration"

financial_impact:
  daily_loss: -22.61
  source: "SPY share liquidation"
  iron_condor_trades: 0

lessons:
  - "ALWAYS check option expiration lands on Friday BEFORE other debugging"
  - "Options expire on Fridays - calculate to nearest Friday, not exact DTE"
  - "Test expiration calculation locally before relying on workflow"
  - "Time is money - faster root cause analysis needed"

fix_applied:
  file: "scripts/iron_condor_trader.py"
  change: "Expiration now calculates to next Friday >= 30 DTE"
  verified: false

next_steps:
  - "Monday: Verify iron condor executes with Friday expiration"
  - "Add unit test for expiration calculation"
  - "Pre-market validation of option symbols before trading"
