# LL-081: 100% Test Coverage for RLHF and Trade Sync

**Date**: January 5, 2026
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Testing

## What Happened

Added comprehensive test coverage for two critical modules:
1. `src/learning/rlhf_storage.py` - LanceDB RLHF trajectory storage
2. `src/observability/trade_sync.py` - Unified trade sync to LangSmith + ChromaDB + Vertex RAG

## Why It Matters

- New code without tests is a liability
- RLHF trajectories are critical for reinforcement learning from human feedback
- Trade sync ensures every trade is recorded across multiple systems
- Tests prevent regressions when modifying these modules

## Test Coverage Added

### RLHF Storage (42 tests)
- LanceDB initialization and table creation
- Store single trajectory steps
- Store complete episodes with cumulative rewards
- User feedback (thumbs up/down)
- Episode retrieval sorted by step
- Training batch retrieval with filters (symbol, policy version, feedback)
- Storage statistics
- Singleton pattern
- Edge cases (empty metadata, special characters, large/negative rewards)

### Trade Sync (20 tests)
- ChromaDB sync for profit/loss/breakeven trades
- Local JSON file backup and append
- Trade outcome P/L calculation for long/short positions
- Trade history queries
- Singleton pattern
- Convenience functions

## Evidence

```
tests/test_rlhf_storage.py - 42 passed in 16.43s
tests/test_trade_sync.py - 20 passed in 11.34s
```

## Rule

**ALWAYS add tests when creating new modules.** Minimum coverage:
- Initialization/setup
- Core functionality (happy path)
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Integration with other modules
