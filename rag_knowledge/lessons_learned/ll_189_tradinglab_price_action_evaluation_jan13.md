# LL-189: TradingLab Price Action Strategy Evaluation

**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** resource-evaluation, strategy-research
**Verdict:** FLUFF (for our use case)

## Resource Evaluated

**Title:** "The Only Trading Strategy You'll Ever Need"
**Source:** TradingLab (YouTube)
**URL:** https://youtu.be/e-QmGJJU1XYc

## Strategy Summary

3-step price action formula:
1. Identify valid market structure (higher highs/lows for uptrend)
2. Identify supply/demand zones (consolidation before impulsive moves)
3. Apply 2.5:1 minimum risk-to-reward ratio

## Why Rejected

### 1. Incompatible with Credit Spreads
- Credit spreads are inherently low R:R (risk $400, make $100)
- TradingLab requires 2.5:1 minimum (risk $100, make $250)
- These strategies are mutually exclusive

### 2. PDT Rule Barrier
- Day trading requires $25K minimum
- Our account: $5K
- Strategy not executable

### 3. Phil Town Conflict
- TradingLab: pure technical analysis, no fundamentals
- Phil Town: moat, management, margin of safety REQUIRED
- Zero fundamental analysis = speculating, not investing

### 4. Capital Efficiency
- Price action needs leverage for meaningful returns
- Credit spreads use defined-risk collateral
- Different capital structures

## What We Learned

- Valid strategy for different account types (futures, forex, $25K+ equity)
- Confirms our credit spread approach is correct for $5K accounts
- Reinforces importance of matching strategy to capital level
