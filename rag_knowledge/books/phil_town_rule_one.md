## Core Philosophy

### Rule #1: Don't Lose Money
- Warren Buffett's first rule of investing
- Rule #2: Don't forget Rule #1
- Focus on CERTAINTY over potential returns
- Only invest in "wonderful companies" at "attractive prices"

### The 4 Ms Framework

#### 1. Meaning
- Do you understand the business?
- Would you understand it without looking at the stock price?
- Could you explain it to a 10-year-old?
- Is it within your "Circle of Competence"?

**Key Questions:**
- What does the company do to make money?
- Who are its customers?
- What problem does it solve?
- Would you want to own the whole business?

#### 2. Moat (Competitive Advantage)
Five types of moats:
1. **Brand** - Coca-Cola, Apple, Nike
2. **Secret** - Patents, trade secrets (Pfizer, Google algorithm)
3. **Toll Bridge** - Monopoly/duopoly position (utilities, Visa/Mastercard)
4. **Switching Costs** - Too expensive to leave (Microsoft Office, Oracle)
5. **Price** - Lowest cost producer (Walmart, Costco)

**Moat Durability Test:**
- Has the moat existed for 10+ years?
- Will it exist for 10+ more years?
- Is it widening or narrowing?

#### 3. Management
- CEO should be owner-oriented
- Check insider ownership (>5% is good)
- Read annual letter to shareholders
- Look for candor about mistakes
- Compensation should align with shareholders

**Red Flags:**
- Excessive executive compensation
- Frequent acquisitions that destroy value
- Empire building vs. shareholder returns
- Promotional/hype-focused communication

#### 4. Margin of Safety (MOS)
- Buy at 50% or less of intrinsic value
- Protects against calculation errors
- Provides significant upside potential
- Never pay full price for any stock

## The Big Five Numbers

### Must ALL grow at 10%+ over 1, 5, and 10 years:

1. **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**
   - Net Income / (Equity + Long-term Debt)
   - Shows management efficiency
   - Should be >10% and consistent

2. **Sales Growth (Revenue)**
   - Top-line growth trajectory
   - Must be sustainable, not one-time

3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth**
   - Bottom-line growth
   - Quality of earnings matters

4. **Book Value Per Share (BVPS) Growth**
   - Net assets per share
   - Shows retained earnings accumulation

5. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Growth**
   - Cash left after capital expenditures
   - Most important - cash is truth

### The 10-10-10 Rule
All Big Five must show:
- 10%+ growth over past 10 years
- 10%+ growth over past 5 years
- 10%+ growth over past 1 year

If ANY fails, the company fails Rule #1 screening.

## Sticker Price Calculation

### Formula Components:

1. **Current EPS** - Trailing 12-month earnings per share
2. **Growth Rate** - Lower of (historical growth, analyst estimates, ROIC)
3. **Future PE** - 2x Growth Rate (capped at 40)
4. **Minimum Acceptable Return** - 15% (Rule #1 standard)

### Calculation Steps:

```
Step 1: Future EPS (10 years out)
Future EPS = Current EPS × (1 + Growth Rate)^10

Step 2: Future Stock Price
Future Price = Future EPS × Future PE

Step 3: Sticker Price (Present Value)
Sticker Price = Future Price / (1 + 0.15)^10

Step 4: Margin of Safety Price (MOS)
MOS Price = Sticker Price × 0.50
```

### Example:
```
Current EPS: $5.00
Growth Rate: 12%
Future PE: 24 (2 × 12)

Future EPS = $5.00 × (1.12)^10 = $15.53
Future Price = $15.53 × 24 = $372.72
Sticker Price = $372.72 / (1.15)^10 = $92.15
MOS Price = $92.15 × 0.50 = $46.08

→ Only buy at $46.08 or below
```

## Options Strategy (From "Payback Time")

### Cash-Secured Put Strategy

**When to Sell Puts:**
- Stock is in your Rule #1 universe
- Current price is ABOVE your MOS price
- You WANT to own the stock at lower price
- You have cash to buy if assigned

**Strike Selection:**
- Sell at or slightly above MOS price
- 21-45 DTE for optimal theta decay
- Collect premium while waiting for entry

**Example:**
```
MOS Price: $46
Current Price: $55
Sell Put Strike: $47
Premium: $1.50

Outcome A: Stock stays above $47
→ Keep $1.50 premium, repeat

Outcome B: Assigned at $47
→ Effective cost: $47 - $1.50 = $45.50
→ Below MOS! Great entry!
```

### Covered Call Strategy

**When to Sell Calls:**
- You own a Rule #1 stock
- Price is approaching Sticker Price
- You're willing to sell at that price
- Lock in profits while collecting premium

**Strike Selection:**
- Sell at or above Sticker Price
- 21-45 DTE for optimal theta decay
- Accept assignment as profit-taking

**Example:**
```
Sticker Price: $92
Current Price: $85
Sell Call Strike: $95
Premium: $2.00

Outcome A: Stock stays below $95
→ Keep $2.00 premium, keep stock

Outcome B: Called away at $95
→ Total return: ($95 - $46 cost) + $2 = $51
→ 111% return on original investment
```

## The Rule #1 Trading Cycle

### Phase 1: Research
1. Find company with strong Big Five
2. Verify 4 Ms (Meaning, Moat, Management, MOS)
3. Calculate Sticker Price and MOS Price

### Phase 2: Wait for Entry
1. If price > MOS: Sell cash-secured puts at MOS strike
2. Collect premium while waiting
3. Get assigned below MOS = excellent entry

### Phase 3: Hold Position
1. Own wonderful company at attractive price
2. Optionally sell covered calls near Sticker Price
3. Collect additional income while holding

### Phase 4: Exit
1. Price reaches Sticker Price = sell or let calls assign
2. Big Five deteriorate = sell regardless of price
3. Better opportunity found = rotate capital
