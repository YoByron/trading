      "date": "2024",
      "topics": ["mean_reversion", "rsi", "sp500"],
      "content": "Buy SPY when RSI(2) < 10, sell when RSI(2) > 90. Backtested 1993-2024: Win rate 75%, Avg gain 0.8%, Max drawdown 25%. Enhancements: Add VIX filter (VIX > 20), add trend filter (price > 200 SMA). Implementation: Reduce size when RSI(2) > 5, full size only at extreme oversold. Holding period: 1-5 days.",
      "key_takeaway": "RSI(2) < 10 on SPY has 75%+ win rate over 30 years. Works because short-term oversold reverts quickly.",
      "code_snippet": "if rsi_2 < 10 and close > sma_200: buy; if rsi_2 > 90: sell",

      "content": "At month end: Rank universe by 12-1 month momentum, buy top 3-5 assets. Universe: SPY, QQQ, IWM, EFA, EEM, TLT, GLD. Hold 1 month. Backtested 2003-2024: CAGR 12.3%, Sharpe 0.85, Max DD 28%. Enhancement: Add cash filter (if all negative momentum, go to cash). This beats buy-and-hold by 3-4% annually with lower drawdowns.",
      "key_takeaway": "Monthly rotation across asset classes captures momentum while providing diversification.",

      "date": "2024",
      "topics": ["volatility", "vix", "mean_reversion"],
      "content": "When VIX spikes (VIX > 1.2 * SMA(20)), buy SPY at close. Hold for 5 days. Backtested 1990-2024: Win rate 68%, Avg gain 1.2%. Rationale: VIX mean reverts, high VIX = high fear = buying opportunity. Enhancement: Scale position by VIX level (bigger position at VIX > 30). Caution: 2008/2020 drawdowns were severe - use stop loss at -5%.",

Implementation: Buy SPY on last day of month, sell on day 4 of new month. Win rate 62%, Avg gain 0.5% per cycle. Best months: October-January. Avoid: September.",

This filters out overbought conditions.",

Backtested 2000-2024: Win rate 71%, Avg gain 2.1%, Holding period 5-15 days. Works because multi-timeframe divergence indicates exhaustion of selling pressure.",
