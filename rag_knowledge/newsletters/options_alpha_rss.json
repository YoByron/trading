      "description": "Backtested 15 option strategies over 10 years. Key finding: Systematic execution beats discretionary by 7.2% annually. Why? (1) Removes emotion, (2) ensures consistent position sizing, (3) captures more opportunities. Best strategies for automation: Iron condors (SPX, 45 DTE), credit spreads (high IV rank), and strangles (earnings). Use IV rank > 50 filter for entries.",

For options: 70% win rate, 1:1 R/R → 40% Kelly = 4% position size. Full Kelly too aggressive (high drawdowns). Use 25-50% fractional Kelly. Tested on 5000 trades: 25% Kelly = 18.4% CAGR, 22% max DD.

      "description": "Common backtesting mistakes: (1) Optimizing on same data, (2) ignoring transaction costs, (3) using closing prices (should use bid/ask). Solution: Walk-forward analysis with 70/30 train/test split. Test on out-of-sample data. Include $1-2 slippage per contract. Survivorship bias: Use all stocks (including delisted). Reality check: If strategy shows 90%+ win rate, probably curve-fitted.",

Recommendation: Use IV Rank for options selling (captures spikes), IV Percentile for longer-term positioning. Both work - choose one and be consistent.",
