      "description": "VIX measures 30-day forward SPX implied volatility. VIX < 15 = complacency, VIX > 30 = fear/panic. Historical analysis: VIX mean = 19.5, median = 17.3. VIX spikes (>40) occurred in 2008, 2020, and brief periods in 2022. Term structure matters: Contango (front < back) = normal, backwardation (front > back) = stress. Trade implications: Mean reversion trades work when VIX > 25.",
