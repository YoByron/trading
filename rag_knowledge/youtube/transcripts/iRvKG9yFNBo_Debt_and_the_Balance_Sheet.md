Debt can destroy even great businesses. When analyzing a company, I look at
debt-to-equity ratio. Under 0.5 is comfortable. Over 1.0 is a warning sign. Over 2.0 is dangerous.
Also check interest coverage ratio - can earnings cover interest payments 5 times or more? Why does
debt matter? In good times, leverage amplifies returns. But in downturns, debt kills. Companies with
heavy debt can't weather recessions. They cut dividends, sell assets, or go bankrupt. Compare to
companies like Apple or Berkshire with net cash positions. They thrive during crises, buying distressed
assets cheap. Look at debt maturity schedule. If lots of debt comes due during a recession, trouble
follows. Also check if debt is fixed or variable rate. Rising rates can crush variable-rate borrowers.
The best Rule #1 companies have fortress balance sheets. They might use some debt for strategic
advantage, but they never bet the company on leverage.
