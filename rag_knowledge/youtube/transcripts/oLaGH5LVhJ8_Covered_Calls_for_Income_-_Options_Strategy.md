Covered calls are perfect for generating income on stocks you own. Here's how
it works: you own 100 shares and sell someone the right to buy them at a higher price. You get paid
premium upfront. If the stock stays below the strike, you keep the shares and the premium. If it goes
above, your shares get called away but you sold at a profit. The key is choosing the right strike
price. I sell calls 10-15% above current price, 30-45 days out. This gives decent premium while leaving
room for gains. Only sell covered calls on stocks you're willing to sell at that price. On wonderful
companies, I use this during periods of overvaluation. If a stock hits sticker price, selling covered
calls generates income while you wait for it to drop. Combine with cash secured puts in the wheel
strategy for continuous income generation. Just remember: you're capping upside in exchange for
certain income.
