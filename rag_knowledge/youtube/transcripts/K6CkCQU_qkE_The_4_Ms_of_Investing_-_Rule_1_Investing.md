The 4 Ms are the foundation of Rule #1 investing. First M is Meaning - invest
only in businesses you understand. You should be able to explain what the company does in one sentence.
Second M is Moat - the company must have a durable competitive advantage. Look for brand moats, secret
moats like patents, toll bridge moats like utilities, switching cost moats, and low-cost moats. Third M
is Management - the people running the company must be honest and talented. Check if they own stock,
if they're buying more, and read their letters to shareholders. Fourth M is Margin of Safety - always
buy at a price significantly below the company's true value. I recommend a 50% margin of safety for
individual investors. Calculate the sticker price using the Rule of 72 and growth rates, then cut it
in half for your buy price. This protects you from errors in your analysis.
