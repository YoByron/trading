Warren Buffett says to stay within your circle of competence. This means only
investing in businesses you truly understand. If you can't explain how the company makes money in one
sentence, it's outside your circle. Your circle might be small - that's okay. It's better to have a
small circle and stay inside it than a big circle you don't really understand. To expand your circle,
study industries you use every day. If you work in healthcare, you understand those businesses better
than most. If you love technology, study tech companies deeply. Read annual reports, understand the
competitive landscape, know the key metrics. The goal is not to invest in everything - it's to be
right when you do invest. Charlie Munger says knowing where the edge of your competence is might be
more valuable than the competence itself. Don't fake it. Be honest about what you don't know.
