Market crashes are the best thing that can happen to a Rule #1 investor. While
everyone panics, we see opportunity. In 2008, wonderful companies dropped 50% or more. Apple, Amazon,
Berkshire - all on sale. This is when you deploy capital aggressively. But preparation is key. Have
cash ready. Keep your watchlist updated with sticker prices. When the crash comes, you know exactly
what to buy and at what price. The hardest part is psychological. Your portfolio is down, news is
terrifying, everyone is selling. That's exactly when you buy. Remember: price is what you pay, value
is what you get. The value of great companies doesn't drop just because prices do. If anything, it
increases as weak competitors fail. Buffett made his best investments during panics. Be greedy when
others are fearful. The next crash is coming - the question is whether you'll be ready to act.
