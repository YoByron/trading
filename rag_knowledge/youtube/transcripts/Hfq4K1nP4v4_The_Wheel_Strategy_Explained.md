The wheel strategy combines cash secured puts and covered calls for consistent
income. Step 1: Sell cash secured puts on a stock you want to own. Collect premium. Step 2: If
assigned, you now own the shares at a discount. Step 3: Sell covered calls on your shares. Collect
more premium. Step 4: If your shares get called away, you've sold at a profit. Go back to step 1.
This creates a wheel of income generation. The beauty is every outcome is profitable when done on
wonderful companies. You either get paid to wait, buy at a discount, or sell at a profit. The key is
selecting the right stocks - companies with strong fundamentals that you'd be happy to own long-term.
I use the 4 Ms to filter stocks for the wheel. Aim for monthly income of 2-4% on the capital employed.
This compounds to significant annual returns while managing risk through stock selection.
