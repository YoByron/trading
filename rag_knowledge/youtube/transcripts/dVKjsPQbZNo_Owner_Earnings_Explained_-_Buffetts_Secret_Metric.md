Owner earnings is Warren Buffett's preferred measure of company profitability.
It's different from net income because it shows what owners actually receive. The formula is: net
income plus depreciation and amortization minus capital expenditures needed to maintain competitive
position. This tells you the real cash available to shareholders. Why is this better than net income?
Because net income includes non-cash charges and doesn't account for required reinvestment. A company
might show profits but need to spend all of it on equipment. Owner earnings reveals this. Look for
companies where owner earnings grow consistently over time. If owner earnings are significantly lower
than net income, the company requires heavy capital investment. If owner earnings exceed net income,
the business generates more cash than reported. This is the true measure of value for calculating
intrinsic value. Use owner earnings in your sticker price calculations.
