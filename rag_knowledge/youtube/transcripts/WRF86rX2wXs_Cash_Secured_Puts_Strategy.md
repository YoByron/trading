Cash secured puts are an amazing strategy for Rule #1 investors. Here's how it
works: You sell a put option on a stock you want to own, and you get paid a premium upfront. If the
stock stays above your strike price, you keep the premium - free money. If the stock falls below your
strike price, you buy the shares at a discount to the current price, plus you keep the premium. This
is a win-win situation when done on wonderful companies. The key is to only sell puts on companies
you actually want to own at that price. Choose a strike price that gives you a good margin of safety.
I typically sell puts 30-45 days out, at a strike price 10-20% below current price. This generates
consistent income while waiting to buy companies on your watchlist. Warren Buffett has used this
strategy to acquire Coca-Cola shares. Just make sure you have the cash to buy if assigned.
