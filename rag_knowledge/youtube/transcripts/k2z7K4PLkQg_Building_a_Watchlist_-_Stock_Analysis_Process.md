Every great investment starts with a watchlist. I keep a list of 10-20
wonderful companies I'd love to own at the right price. How do I build it? Start with companies you
understand and use. Apply the 4 Ms filter rigorously. Meaning - can you explain it simply? Moat - what
protects their profits? Management - do they own stock and act like owners? Then calculate the sticker
price for each. Track the current price versus sticker price weekly. When price drops to half of
sticker price or below, that's your buy signal. Keep notes on each company: why you like it, what
risks you see, key metrics to monitor. Update your watchlist quarterly. Companies fall off when
fundamentals deteriorate. New companies get added when you complete analysis. The watchlist creates
patience. Instead of forcing investments, you wait for Mr Market to offer discounts on businesses
you've already vetted.
