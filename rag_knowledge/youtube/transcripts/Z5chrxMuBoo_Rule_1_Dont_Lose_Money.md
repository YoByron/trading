Rule #1 of investing is simple: Don't lose money. Rule #2: Don't forget
Rule #1. Warren Buffett says these are the only rules that matter. What does this mean practically?
It means protecting your capital is more important than making gains. If you lose 50%, you need 100%
gains just to break even. That's why margin of safety is so critical. It means only investing in
companies you understand with durable competitive advantages. It means never overpaying, no matter
how good the company. It means being patient - waiting for the right opportunities instead of
forcing trades. It means cutting losses quickly when you're wrong. Most investors focus on making
money. The best investors focus on not losing money - the gains take care of themselves. This
mindset shift is what separates amateur investors from professionals. Start with Rule #1 and you'll
avoid the mistakes that destroy most portfolios.
