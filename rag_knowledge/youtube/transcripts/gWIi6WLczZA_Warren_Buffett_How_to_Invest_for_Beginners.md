Warren Buffett is the greatest investor of all time. His strategy is simple:
buy wonderful companies at fair prices and hold them forever. Buffett looks for businesses with durable
competitive advantages - what he calls moats. A moat protects a company from competition like a moat
protects a castle. Types of moats include brand loyalty like Coca-Cola, network effects like Visa,
switching costs like Microsoft, and low-cost production like Costco. Buffett also emphasizes margin
of safety - buying at a discount to intrinsic value. He calculates intrinsic value using owner earnings
and growth rates. For beginners, Buffett recommends index funds if you don't have time to research
individual stocks. But if you do your homework, concentrated positions in wonderful companies can
generate superior returns. The key is patience - Buffett's favorite holding period is forever.
