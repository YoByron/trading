The sticker price is the true value of a company based on future cash flows.
Here's how I calculate it. First, get the current EPS - earnings per share. Then determine the growth
rate - use the lower of analyst estimates or historical growth. Apply the Rule of 72 to project EPS
10 years out. Take that future EPS and multiply by twice the growth rate to get future PE ratio.
Multiply future EPS by future PE to get future price. Then discount back to today using a 15% minimum
acceptable rate of return. That gives you the sticker price. For example: $5 EPS growing 12% becomes
$15.50 in 10 years. Future PE of 24 means future price of $372. Discounted at 15% gives sticker price
of $92. Buy at half that for margin of safety - so $46. This systematic approach removes emotion from
investing and ensures you never overpay for even the best companies.
