Phil Town here. Today I want to talk about how to invest in stocks for beginners.
The most important thing is to understand Rule #1: Don't lose money. Warren Buffett said this is the most
important rule of investing. The second rule is: Don't forget rule #1. What this means is we need to find
wonderful companies at attractive prices with a margin of safety. A wonderful company has four things:
Meaning - you understand the business. Moat - it has a competitive advantage. Management - good people
running it. And Margin of Safety - you can buy it at a discount to its true value. Start by looking at
companies you understand, that you use every day. Then analyze their financials - look at the Big Five
numbers: ROIC, Equity growth, EPS growth, Sales growth, and Cash flow growth. All should be above 10%
for at least 10 years. This is value investing at its core.
