Understanding financial statements is essential for value investing. There
are three main statements. The Income Statement shows revenue, expenses, and profit over time. Look
for consistent revenue growth and expanding profit margins. The Balance Sheet shows assets,
liabilities, and equity at a point in time. Strong companies have more assets than liabilities and
growing equity. The Cash Flow Statement shows actual cash moving in and out. This is the most
important - earnings can be manipulated but cash flow is real. Look at operating cash flow, not just
net income. The Big Five Numbers I use are: ROIC - Return on Invested Capital, should be above 10%.
Equity growth rate. EPS growth rate. Sales growth rate. And free cash flow growth rate. All five
should show consistent growth of 10% or more over 10 years. Red flags include declining margins,
rising debt, and cash flow that doesn't match earnings. Practice reading 10-K annual reports.
