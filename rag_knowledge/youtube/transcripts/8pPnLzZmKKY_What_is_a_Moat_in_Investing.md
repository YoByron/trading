A moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that protects a company's profits
from competitors. Warren Buffett coined this term because a moat around a castle protects it from
invaders. There are five types of moats. Brand moat - companies like Apple and Coca-Cola have such
strong brands that customers pay premium prices. Secret moat - patents and trade secrets like
pharmaceutical companies. Toll bridge moat - companies you must use, like railroads or utilities.
Switching cost moat - it's too expensive or difficult to switch, like enterprise software. Low-cost
moat - companies that can produce cheaper than anyone else, like Costco or Walmart. Wide moats last
decades, narrow moats might last 5-10 years. When analyzing a company, ask: what stops competitors
from taking their customers? If there's no clear answer, there's no moat. No moat means no investment.
