Margin of safety is the most important concept in value investing. Benjamin
Graham invented it, Warren Buffett perfected it. Here's how it works: Every company has an intrinsic
value - what it's truly worth based on future cash flows. The market price fluctuates around this
value based on emotions - fear and greed. Margin of safety means buying when the market price is
significantly below intrinsic value. I recommend at least 50% margin of safety. So if a company is
worth $100, wait to buy at $50 or less. This protects you from three things: errors in your analysis,
unexpected bad news, and market volatility. To calculate margin of safety, first determine the sticker
price using growth rates and PE ratios, then divide by 2. Never skip this step. Even the best companies
can be bad investments at the wrong price. As Buffett says: Price is what you pay, value is what you get.
