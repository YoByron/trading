Value investing and growth investing aren't opposites - they're two sides of
the same coin. Value investors look for companies trading below intrinsic value. Growth investors look
for companies with high growth potential. The best investments combine both: wonderful companies with
growth potential trading at value prices. Warren Buffett evolved from pure value to growth at a
reasonable price, which he calls GARP. The key difference is in how you calculate intrinsic value.
Pure value focuses on current assets and earnings. Growth adjusts for future earnings potential.
I prefer growth at value prices - companies growing earnings 15%+ annually, but available at a
margin of safety. The danger of pure growth investing is overpaying. The danger of pure value is
missing great companies. Rule #1 investing finds the middle ground: wonderful businesses with growth,
bought at attractive prices. This is how Buffett became the world's greatest investor.
