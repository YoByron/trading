Knowing when to sell is as important as knowing when to buy. There are three
reasons to sell a Rule #1 stock. First, the story changes. If the business fundamentals deteriorate,
the moat narrows, or management makes poor decisions, it's time to exit. Second, the price exceeds
intrinsic value. When Mr Market gets too optimistic and pushes the price well above sticker price,
take profits. Third, you find a better opportunity with higher expected returns. Don't sell just
because the price drops - that might be a buying opportunity. Don't sell because of market fear.
Review your thesis: are the 4 Ms still intact? If yes, volatility is your friend, not your enemy.
Buffett's favorite holding period is forever, but that assumes the business stays wonderful. When it
doesn't, be willing to move on. The goal is compounding returns, and sometimes that means reallocating
capital to better opportunities.
