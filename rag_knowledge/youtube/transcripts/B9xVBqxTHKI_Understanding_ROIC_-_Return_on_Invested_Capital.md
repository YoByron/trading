ROIC is the most important number in Rule #1 investing. Return on Invested
Capital shows how efficiently a company turns investment into profit. The formula is: operating income
divided by invested capital. Invested capital is equity plus debt minus cash. A great company has ROIC
above 10% consistently. Above 15% is excellent. Above 20% is world-class. Why does ROIC matter?
Because it shows the company's competitive advantage in numbers. High ROIC means the moat is working.
Low ROIC means competition is eating into profits. Compare ROIC to cost of capital. If ROIC exceeds
cost of capital, the company creates value. If it doesn't, it destroys value. Look for ROIC trends.
Rising ROIC suggests strengthening moat. Falling ROIC is a warning sign. Companies like Apple and
Costco maintain high ROIC for decades. That's what you want to own.
