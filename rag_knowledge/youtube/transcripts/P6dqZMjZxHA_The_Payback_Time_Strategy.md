Payback time tells you how long it takes to recover your investment from a
company's free cash flow. It's a simple but powerful metric. Take the market cap and divide by free
cash flow. A company with $100 billion market cap and $10 billion free cash flow has a 10-year
payback. I look for payback times under 8 years for wonderful companies. Under 5 years is a bargain.
Why use payback time? Because it incorporates both price and earnings power. A cheap stock with weak
cash flow might have long payback. An expensive stock with massive cash flow might have short payback.
This helps you compare apples to oranges across industries. During market crashes, payback times shrink
dramatically. That's when Rule #1 investors get excited. The 2008 crisis created 3-year payback on
companies like Apple. That's generational opportunity. Track payback times on your watchlist and wait
for them to get short enough.
