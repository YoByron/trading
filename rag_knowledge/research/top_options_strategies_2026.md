## Executive Summary

For small accounts ($500-$5,000), the most recommended strategies are:

1. **Cash-Secured Puts (CSPs)** - Phil Town "Getting Paid to Wait"
2. **Covered Calls** - After assignment, "Getting Paid to Sell"
3. **The Wheel Strategy** - Combines CSPs and Covered Calls
4. **Credit Spreads** - Capital-efficient, defined risk
5. **Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC)** - Lower capital requirement

---

## 1. Cash-Secured Puts (Our Primary Strategy)

### How It Works
- Sell put options on stocks you want to own
- If assigned, you buy at strike price minus premium collected
- If not assigned, keep the premium as income

### Capital Requirements
| Account Size | Max Strike | Example Stocks |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| $500 | $5 | F (Ford), SOFI |
| $1,000 | $10 | INTC, BAC |
| $2,000 | $20 | T, VZ |
| $5,000 | $50 | Multiple CSPs |

### Phil Town Approach
- Only sell CSPs on "wonderful companies at fair prices"
- Sell puts at 50% Margin of Safety (MOS) price
- You get PAID to wait for the stock to come to you

## 2. The Wheel Strategy

### Step-by-Step
1. **Sell Cash-Secured Put** → Collect premium
2. **If assigned** → Own 100 shares at lower price
3. **Sell Covered Call** → Collect more premium
4. **If called away** → Profit on shares + premiums
5. **Repeat** → Perpetual income wheel

### Expected Returns
- 15-20% annually is realistic
- Works best in sideways to bullish markets
- Requires patience and discipline

### Best Stocks for Wheel
- Stable, high-liquidity stocks: MSFT, KO, SPY, QQQ
- Dividend payers enhance returns
- **Our watchlist**: F, SOFI, T, INTC, BAC, VZ (capital-tiered)

## 3. Credit Spreads (Capital-Efficient)

### Why Credit Spreads for Small Accounts
- Lower capital requirement ($200-500 vs $1,000+ for CSPs)
- Defined risk - max loss = width - credit received
- Can be used when buying power is insufficient for CSPs

### Bull Put Spread Example
- Sell $25 put, Buy $23 put
- Collect $0.50 credit
- Max risk = $2 - $0.50 = $1.50 per share
- Capital required: $150 per contract (vs $2,500 for CSP)

## 4. Iron Condors (Neutral Markets)

### Structure
- Sell OTM Put Spread (Bull Put)
- Sell OTM Call Spread (Bear Call)
- Same expiration date
- Profit if stock stays in range

### Risk/Reward
- Max profit = Net credit collected
- Max loss = Width of wider spread - credit
- Best in low volatility environments

### Warning for Small Accounts
- Multiple legs = multiple commissions
- Requires larger account for effective use
- Option Alpha recommends accounts under $25K focus on simpler strategies first

## 5. Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC)

### Why It's Great for Small Accounts
- Controls 100 shares for fraction of cost
- Example: Ford CSP needs $1,200, PMCC needs ~$400
- Can generate $10-15/week in premium

### Structure
- Buy deep ITM LEAPS call (6+ months out)
- Sell OTM weekly/monthly calls against it
- LEAPS acts as substitute for owning shares

## Risk Management Rules (All Strategies)

### Position Sizing
- Never risk more than **5% of account** on single trade
- Option Alpha: "As soon as you start getting over 5%... the likelihood that you have a run of trades that go against you... and blow up your account is exponentially higher"

### Strategy Selection by Account Size

| Account Size | Recommended Strategies |
|--------------|------------------------|
| $500 | Long calls/puts, PMCC on cheap stocks |
| $1,000 | Credit spreads, single CSPs on $5-10 stocks |
| $2,000 | Wheel on affordable stocks (F, SOFI) |
| $5,000 | Full wheel, iron condors, multiple positions |

### Realistic Expectations
- Target: **1-2% account growth per week**
- Compounding: Could double account in ~1 year
- **Capital preservation is PRIMARY focus**

## Warren Buffett Connection

> "Warren Buffett famously sells cash-secured puts on stocks he'd love to own at a discount. While he doesn't call it a 'wheel strategy,' his approach aligns with the first step of the wheel—selling puts with the intention of acquiring quality companies at fair prices."

This is exactly Phil Town's approach - he learned from Buffett!
