## Key Thesis

> "Whoever wins the energy race wins the AI race."

The massive power demands of AI data centers are forcing a global shift in energy strategy. This creates investment opportunities in:
1. Critical minerals (rare earths, antimony, gallium)
2. Nuclear power (uranium, SMRs)
3. Energy infrastructure companies

## Actionable Investment Insights

### 1. Critical Mineral Supply Chain Risk

**The Problem:**
- China controls ~70% of critical mineral PRODUCTION
- China controls ~90% of critical mineral PROCESSING (harder bottleneck)
- Western allies lack viable alternative supply chains

**Investment Implications:**
- Companies building Western processing capacity = strategic value
- Australia stockpiling antimony & gallium = first mover
- Watch for "joint market" announcements between Western allies

**Potential Plays:**
- Rare earth miners with Western processing (MP Materials, Lynas)
- Antimony/gallium producers
- Defense contractors with mineral security exposure

---

### 2. Nuclear Power Renaissance

**The Catalyst:**
- "All-of-government" shift in US to fast-track nuclear
- Tech giants (Meta, Microsoft) seeking nuclear licenses for AI data centers
- SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) gaining regulatory traction

**Investment Implications:**
- Uranium demand set to surge
- Australia holds 1/3 of world's uranium supply (strategic asset)
- Nuclear construction/engineering firms positioned to benefit

**Potential Plays:**
- Uranium miners: CCJ (Cameco), UEC, UUUU, DNN
- Nuclear utilities with AI data center deals
- SMR developers: NuScale, Oklo (if public)

---

### 3. Condensed Competitive Window

**Timeline Warning:**
- "Next couple of years" = critical window for energy dominance
- One country/bloc will likely prevail
- West must advance chips AND energy simultaneously

**Strategic Implication:**
- This is a SHORT-TERM CATALYST thesis (2-3 year horizon)
- Early movers in uranium/nuclear/rare earths could see significant appreciation
- Watch for policy announcements, subsidies, defense contracts

## Trading Relevance

### Connection to Our Strategy

| Factor | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|
| Uranium stocks (CCJ, UUUU) | Potential long-term equity positions |
| Energy ETFs (XLE, ICLN) | Options plays during policy catalysts |
| Critical minerals | Sector exposure for diversification |
| Nuclear utilities | Stable dividend + AI data center upside |

### Risk Factors
- Political volatility (uranium policies vary by administration)
- China retaliation risk on mineral exports
- Nuclear project delays (historical precedent)
- Technology disruption (fusion breakthrough would change thesis)
