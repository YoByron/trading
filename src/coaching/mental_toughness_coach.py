    Based on Steve Siebold's "177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class",

    Key coaching areas:
    - Emotional compartmentalization (don't let losses bleed)
    - Metacognition (think about your thinking)
    - Operating from abundance (not fear/scarcity)
    - Failure reframing (losses are data, not defeat)
