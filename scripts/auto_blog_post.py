# {title}

Phil Town's Rule #1 is simple: **Don't lose money.**

Today, our AI trading system violated this rule. Here's what happened and how we fixed it.

            """
## The Fix

We implemented automatic protections:
1. **Position monitoring** - Track P/L in real-time
2. **Duplicate prevention** - Never double down on losing trades
3. **Emergency closure** - Auto-close positions that violate Rule #1

## Lesson Recorded

This is now in our RAG memory. The AI cannot make this mistake again.

## Key Takeaway

> "The first rule of investing is don't lose money. The second rule is don't forget rule #1." - Phil Town
