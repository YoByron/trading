# Claude Agent Progress Log

This file tracks agent progress across multiple context windows. Each agent session should read this file first to understand recent work, then update it at the end of the session.

## Format
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- Agent: Description of what was accomplished
- Files Changed: List of files modified
- Next Steps: What should be done next

## Recent Progress

[This file will be updated by agents after each session]

---

## Session Template

When starting a new session, agents should:
1. Read this file to understand recent work
2. Read `feature_list.json` to see feature status
3. Read git logs (`git log --oneline -20`) to see recent commits
4. Choose ONE feature to work on
5. Update this file at the end of the session

2025-12-01 14:30 - GPT-5.1 Codex
Summary:
- Added Finnhub-based economic guardrails, regime-aware trend snapshots, and daily report telemetry so Tier 1/2 allocations know when gates are open.
- Wired RLPolicyLearner plus DeepMomentumForecaster into CoreStrategy, enabling RL vetoes, probability boosts, and automatic Sentry reporting across all entrypoints.
- Created `tests/test_trading_e2e.py` and `tests/test_sentry_integration.py` to keep the hybrid funnel covered end-to-end.

Files Changed:
- `src/strategies/core_strategy.py`, `src/utils/economic_guardrails.py`, `src/utils/trend_snapshot.py`, `src/ml/forecasters/deep_momentum.py`, scripts (`autonomous_trader.py`, `advanced_autonomous_trader.py`, `daily_report.py`, `pre_market_health_check.py`), docs/PLAN.md, `feature_list.json`, and new tests.

Next Steps:
- Monitor guardrail cache freshness and surface alerts externally if Finnhub reports major events.
- Extend RL reward shaping with benchmark-aware metrics once more trades close, and consider sharing trend + guardrail snapshots on the dashboard.

2025-12-01 16:05 - GPT-5.1 Codex
Summary:
- Adopted Anthropic’s “Define Success” framework by authoring `docs/define-success.md` with scorecards, metrics, and evaluation cadences mapped to our R&D goals.
- Linked the success playbook into `docs/r-and-d-phase.md` and marked it as required reading in `README.md` so future iterations inherit the same guardrails.

Files Changed:
- `docs/define-success.md`, `docs/r-and-d-phase.md`, `README.md`

Next Steps:
- Wire guardrail freshness + success metrics directly into the dashboard telemetry, then enforce PR templates that reference the new scorecard rows.

2025-12-01 18:45 - GPT-5.1 Codex
Summary:
- Added `FailureIsolationManager` and wired every funnel gate (momentum → RL → LLM → risk → execution) through sandboxed runners that emit structured telemetry, retry locally, and drop failing tickers without crashing the loop.
- Extended `ContextEngine` with memory removal/pruning plus multi-timescale cleanup so failure logs can be edited out of agent context per Armin Ronacher’s guidance; failure reports now land in `data/audit_trail/failure_sandboxes/`.
- Authored regression tests for the new isolation stack, updated resilience + architecture docs, and logged the work in `claude-progress.txt`.

Files Changed:
- `src/orchestrator/main.py`, `src/orchestrator/failure_isolation.py`, `src/agent_framework/context_engine.py`, `tests/test_failure_isolation.py`, `docs/RESILIENCE_STRATEGY.md`, `docs/MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `claude-progress.txt`

Next Steps:
- Surface the new sandbox telemetry on the dashboard and pipe failure summaries into the daily CEO report so incidents are visible without digging into JSON logs.

2025-12-01 20:15 - GPT-5.1 Codex
Summary:
- Enforced ClaudeLog Plan Mode mechanics across the repo with a root-level `plan.md`, Opus-style workflow docs, and a guard script that blocks commits without an approved plan.
- Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `README.md`, and the new `docs/PLAN_MODE_ENFORCEMENT.md` so every agent knows Plan Mode is mandatory before edits.
- Wired `.claude/hooks/pre-commit` into `scripts/verify_plan_mode.py`, exempted `plan.md` from relocation, and documented the change in the progress log.

Files Changed:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/hooks/pre-commit`, `plan.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PLAN_MODE_ENFORCEMENT.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/verify_plan_mode.py`, `claude-progress.txt`

Next Steps:
- Keep `plan.md` up to date per task and monitor the guardrail output; expand the guard with auto-linking to task IDs if we need finer traceability.
