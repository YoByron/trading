## Session Template

When starting a new session, agents should:
1. Read this file to understand recent work
2. Read `feature_list.json` to see feature status
3. Read git logs (`git log --oneline -20`) to see recent commits

Summary:
- Added Finnhub-based economic guardrails, regime-aware trend snapshots, and daily report telemetry so Tier 1/2 allocations know when gates are open.
- Wired RLPolicyLearner plus DeepMomentumForecaster into CoreStrategy, enabling RL vetoes, probability boosts, and automatic Sentry reporting across all entrypoints.
- Created `tests/test_trading_e2e.py` and `tests/test_sentry_integration.py` to keep the hybrid funnel covered end-to-end.

Files Changed:
- `src/strategies/core_strategy.py`, `src/utils/economic_guardrails.py`, `src/utils/trend_snapshot.py`, `src/ml/forecasters/deep_momentum.py`, scripts (`autonomous_trader.py`, `advanced_autonomous_trader.py`, `daily_report.py`, `pre_market_health_check.py`), docs/PLAN.md, `feature_list.json`, and new tests.

Next Steps:
- Monitor guardrail cache freshness and surface alerts externally if Finnhub reports major events.
- Extend RL reward shaping with benchmark-aware metrics once more trades close, and consider sharing trend + guardrail snapshots on the dashboard.
