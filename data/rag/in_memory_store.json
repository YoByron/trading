    "Standard time-sampled bars contain uneven information. Tick bars, volume bars, and dollar bars sample by market activity rather than time, producing more normally distributed returns and reducing heteroscedasticity. Information-driven bars (tick imbalance, volume imbalance) detect when informed traders are active.",
    "Time bars oversample low-activity periods and undersample high-activity periods, leading to poor statistical properties",
    "Volume bars sample when a fixed amount of volume has traded, normalizing return distributions",
    "Dollar bars are particularly useful for assets that have split or changed price significantly",
    "Tick imbalance bars detect when buying or selling pressure becomes significant - use \u03b8 = E[T] * (2P[b=1] - 1) as threshold",
    "Volume/dollar imbalance bars weight each tick by its size, providing more stable thresholds",
    "Tick Imbalance Bar Threshold: \u03b8 = E[T] * |2P[b=1] - 1|\n\nExplanation: Expected tick imbalance where T is expected bar length and P[b=1] is probability of uptick. A new bar forms when cumulative signed ticks exceed \u03b8.",
    "Expected Bar Size: E[T] = E[T_0] * |2P[b=1] - 1| / |\u03b8_t - \u03b8_{t-1}|\n\nExplanation: Dynamically adjusts expected bar length based on market activity changes.",
    "Fixed-time horizon labeling ignores path dependency - a trade that hits stop-loss then recovers is mislabeled as win",
    "When vertical barrier is hit first, label is determined by return sign at that point",
    "Meta-labeling: First model generates signals (high recall, low precision acceptable), second model filters",
    "Meta-labeling model outputs position size (0 to 1), not direction - direction comes from primary model",
    "CRITICAL: Meta-labeling allows you to use ML models with low precision as long as recall is high",
    "Triple Barrier Label: y = {1 if upper barrier hit first, -1 if lower barrier hit first, sign(r) if vertical hit first}\n\nExplanation: Where r is the return at the time of the vertical barrier. This captures the actual path-dependent outcome.",
    "Dynamic Barrier Width: width = volatility_multiple * daily_volatility\n\nExplanation: Barriers should scale with volatility. Typical multiples: 1-2x for profit target, 1x for stop-loss.",
    "Overlapping labels cause samples to be non-IID. Sequential bootstrap and sample uniqueness weights correct for this. Without proper weighting, backtests dramatically overfit because they reuse the same information multiple times.",
    "Labels that span overlapping periods share information - treating them as IID causes massive overfitting",
    "Average uniqueness measures what fraction of a label's information is not shared with concurrent labels",
    "Sample weights should be proportional to average uniqueness - more unique samples matter more",
    "Sequential bootstrap: Sample with replacement but weight by uniqueness probability",
    "Time decay: Recent samples should get higher weight - use c parameter (typical 0.5) for exponential decay",
    "CRITICAL: Without sample weights, your backtest's Sharpe is inflated by sqrt(number of overlapping labels)",
    "Average Uniqueness: u_i = (1/|c_i|) * \u03a3_{t\u2208c_i} 1/count_t\n\nExplanation: Where c_i is the set of timestamps spanned by label i, and count_t is how many labels include timestamp t.",
    "Time Decay Weight: w_i = c^(T-t_i)\n\nExplanation: Where c \u2208 (0,1) is decay factor, T is latest timestamp, t_i is sample timestamp. c=0.5 means sample from T-1 has half the weight.",
    "Price series are non-stationary (unit root) which breaks ML assumptions. Standard differencing (returns) loses all memory. Fractional differentiation with d<1 achieves stationarity while preserving memory - the sweet spot is the minimum d that passes ADF test.",
    "Non-stationary series violate OLS assumptions, causing spurious regression and overfitting",
    "Returns (d=1 differencing) are stationary but lose all memory of price levels",
    "Fractional differentiation with d between 0.3-0.7 typically achieves stationarity while keeping memory",
    "Use ADF test to find minimum d that achieves stationarity (p-value < 0.05)",

    "CRITICAL: Features with d\u22480.4 often have better predictive power than returns",

    "Standard k-fold CV leaks information because train and test sets share overlapping label information. Purged k-fold removes training samples that overlap with test labels. Embargo adds a gap between train and test to prevent information leakage from labels near the boundary.",
    "CRITICAL: Standard k-fold causes catastrophic overfitting in financial ML - your 62% backtest is likely ~50% real",
    "Purging: Remove from training any sample whose label overlaps with test period",
    "Embargo: After purging, also remove samples within T_embargo of test period boundary",
    "Typical embargo = 1% of total samples, or based on your label's average span",
    "Combinatorial purged cross-validation (CPCV) tests multiple train/test combinations",
    "ALWAYS use purged CV - standard CV will make your backtest look 10-30% better than reality",
    "Purging Condition: Purge sample i if t_{i,start} < t_{test,end} AND t_{i,end} > t_{test,start}\n\nExplanation: Sample i overlaps with test period if its label's time span intersects the test period.",
    "Embargo Period: T_embargo = pct_embargo * (max(t) - min(t))\n\nExplanation: Typical pct_embargo = 0.01. Remove samples within T_embargo after each test fold boundary.",
    "MDI (default sklearn feature_importances_) is biased - do NOT trust it for finance",
    "MDA: Permute feature values, measure accuracy drop with purged CV - most reliable",
    "SFI: Train model on each feature alone - catches non-linear importance MDI might miss",
    "Cluster correlated features BEFORE importance analysis - otherwise importance is split",
    "Features with high MDI but low MDA are likely overfit - red flag",

In 2011, we will set a newrecord for capital spending \u2013 $8 billion \u2013 and spend allof the $2 billion increase in the United States.\nMoney will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.\nCommentators today often talk of \u201cgreat uncertainty.\u201d But think back, for example, to December 6,1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always\nuncertain.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nDon\u2019t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly\nmoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than\nwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that iscertain: Human potential\nis far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential \u2013 a system that has worked wondersfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War \u2013 remains alive andeffective.\nWe are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder.

Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull\u2019s-eye around wherever it lands.\nIn Berkshire\u2019s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,if we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves couldhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.\nThe challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn\u2019t possible.\nTo eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value \u2013 book value \u2013\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carryingvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we\u2019ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swingswildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.\nThe table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&P, a performance quite good in the earlier\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums ofcapital we currently manage eliminate anychance of exceptional performance.",
    "we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results inbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.\n4\n\nBerkshire\u2019s Corporate Performance vs. the S&P 500 by Five-Year Periods\nAnnual Percentage Change\nFive-Year Periodin Per-Share\nBook Value of\nBerkshire\n(1)in S&P 500\nwith Dividends\nIncluded\n(2)Relative\nResults\n(1)-(2)\n1965-1969 ............................................... 17.2 5.0 12.2\n1966-1970 ............................................... 14.7 3.9 10.8\n1967-1971 ............................................... 13.9 9.2 4.7\n1968-1972 ............................................... 16.8 7.5 9.3\n1969-1973 ............................................... 17.7 2.0 15.7\n1970-1974 ............................................... 15.0 (2.4) 17.4\n1971-1975 ............................................... 13.9 3.2 10.7\n1972-1976 ............................................... 20.8 4.9 15.9\n1973-1977 ............................................... 23.4 (0.2) 23.6\n1974-1978 ............................................... 24.4 4.3 20.1\n1975-1979 ............................................... 30.1 14.7 15.4\n1976-1980 ............................................... 33.4 13.9 19.5\n1977-1981 ............................................... 29.0 8.1 20.9\n1978-1982 ............................................... 29.9 14.1 15.8\n1979-1983 ............................................... 31.6 17.3 14.3\n1980-1984 ............................................... 27.0 14.8 12.2\n1981-1985 ............................................... 32.6 14.6 18.0\n1982-1986 ............................................... 31.5 19.8 11.7\n1983-1987 ............................................... 27.4 16.4 11.0\n1984-1988 ............................................... 25.0 15.2 9.8\n1985-1989 ............................................... 31.1 20.3 10.8\n1986-1990 ...............................................",

All other periods involve calendar years.\nThe other notes on page 2 also apply to this table.\n5\n\nIntrinsic Value \u2013 Today and Tomorrow\nThough Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can be\nmeasured. Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire\u2019s\nvalue.\nThe first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend these\ntotaled $158 billion at market value.\nInsurance float \u2013 money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us \u2013\nfunds $66 billion of our investments. This float is \u201cfree\u201d as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaningthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile,swinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we\u2019ve been significantlyprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of ourinvestments \u2013 those funded both by float and by retained earnings \u2013 can be viewed as an element of value forBerkshire shareholders.\nBerkshire\u2019s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\ninsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106.In Berkshire\u2019s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we\u2019veincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that willcontinue.\nThe following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business.",
    "lcontinue.\nThe following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business.

Over time, you can expect\nour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire\u2019s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsicvalue often follow very different paths \u2013 sometimes for extended periods \u2013 but eventually they meet.\nThere is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future.",
    "y meet.\nThere is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many otherbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presentlyemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dolla rs into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.\nThis \u201cwhat-will-they-do-with-the-money\u201d factor must always be evaluated along with the\n\u201cwhat-do-we-have-now\u201d calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company\u2019sintrinsic value. That\u2019s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of thecompany\u2019s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to thecompany\u2019s current value; if the CEO\u2019s talents or motives are suspect, today\u2019s value must be discounted. Thedifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck\u2019s or MontgomeryWard\u2019s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.\n************\nCharlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at a\ndecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from ourcurrent businesses and more major acquisitions. We\u2019re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my\ntrigger finger is itchy.\nPartially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a\ncadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They arevolunteers, not mercenaries.",
    "s who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They arevolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can\u2019t be luredaway.\nAt Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at\nheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years(it\u2019s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managersto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in peoplerather than process. A \u201chire well, manage little\u201d code suits both them and me.\nBerkshire\u2019s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MBAs; others never finished college. Some use\nbudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squadcomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required.\nOur second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the\nneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves toreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a\u201cuniverse\u201d for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.Competition for the few opportunities that areavailable tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, as\na girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be greatfor the girl, but terrible for the boys.\nAt Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition.",
    "errible for the boys.\nAt Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle \u2013 and frequently wecan\u2019t \u2013 we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others.\n7\n\nWhen I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn\u2019t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in\ntextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was to\npursue \u201copportunities\u201d to improve and expand the existing textile operation \u2013 so for years that\u2019s exactly what Idid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh!\nEventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries.\nThere is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the\nattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available inmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don\u2019t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculouslyhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securitiesand bide our time.\nOur flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We have\nbeen able to take money we earn from, say, See\u2019s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, butalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF.\nOur final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,\nculture counts.\nTo start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash.",
    "es,\nculture counts.\nTo start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide themdirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess upwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families ownBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire\u2019s actions and resultswith keen interest and an owner\u2019s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards.\nThis same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who have\nsought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to uswith an owner\u2019s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managerswho love their businesses is no small advantage.\nCultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, \u201cYou shape your houses and then they shape\nyou.\u201d That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperialcorporate palaces induce imperious behavior.

    "rded an early train forWashington.\nAlas, when I arrived at the company\u2019s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I couldtalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.\nThat was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, \u201cDavy\u201d gave me an education about both\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated fromColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which gotme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon aftermeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.)\nSubsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got\ninto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened \u2013 with the stock falling bymore than 95% \u2013 Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the yearsincreased to 50% because of GEICO\u2019s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire\u2019s cost for this half of the businesswas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)\nWe then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside withBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, \u201cNext time, Warren, please make an appointment.\u201d)\nA lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal \u2013 saving Americans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance \u2013 remains unchanged.

    "icans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance \u2013 remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 orwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder\u2019s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this\nobjective, the company has grown to be America\u2019s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.\nWhen Tony Nicely, GEICO\u2019s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistentgrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.\nLet me quantify Tony\u2019s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn\u2019t already\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangiblenet worth of $1.9 billion.\nThe excess over tangible net worth of the implied value \u2013 $2.7 billion \u2013 was what we estimated\nGEICO\u2019s \u201cgoodwill\u201d to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholderswho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion inpremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO\u2019s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they wereannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinaryinsurer: Because of the company\u2019s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.\nToday, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICOincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic valuedecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick weapplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO\u2019s economic goodwill is about $14 billion.",
    "ver decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at thefollowing table:\nYearend\nFloat\n(in $ millions)\n1970 ........................................ $ 3 9\n1980 ........................................ 2 3 7\n1990 ........................................ 1,632\n2000 ........................................ 27,871\n2010 ........................................ 65,832\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at asignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\nFarm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss inseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\nAt Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwriteprofitably in most \u2013 though certainly not all \u2013 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better thancost-free.",
    "g been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwriteprofitably in most \u2013 though certainly not all \u2013 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better thancost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holdingits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\n10\n\nLet me emphasize again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\nindustry\u2019s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized byAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\u2019s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We\u2019ve already told you about GEICO,but we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way.\n************\nFirst off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one\nelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risksthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative than most large insurers\nin that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annualpremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion and\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By hisaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire.",
    "d\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By hisaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonitebounces off Ajit.\n************\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of allexposures\nthat might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if theappropriate premium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes hasled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. \u201cThe other guy is doing it so we must as well\u201d spellstrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.\n************\nFinally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\ninsurance world.

Some of the businesses\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came aboutbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics ofthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimesmy eyesight has been poor.\nMost of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let\u2019s look\nfirst at the record-breakers.\n\u2022 TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, withNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes arepedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI\u2019s exceptional performance is createdby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\n12\n\n\u2022 Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\nas well.",
    "\u2019s exceptional performance is createdby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\n12\n\n\u2022 Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\nas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter).\nThere\u2019s no need; Pete Liegl, the company\u2019s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products atthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one.\n\u2022 CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Report\nabout Vic Mancinelli, the company\u2019s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 millionfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt.Last year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. Whenwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878.\n\u2022 Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a new\nrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim hasbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by FrankRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golfcourse.\nA huge story in this sector\u2019s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can\u2019t overstate the\nbreadth and importance of Dave Sokol\u2019s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional\nownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five timesthat of its nearest competitor. Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanicsand service personnel.",

We receive no special treatment andhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know weare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation.\nThe largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130\nbusinesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchaseof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase theremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmonwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership.\n13\n\nNext to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years.\nIn 2010, Grady Rosier\u2019s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billion\noperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, anoperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company\u2019s dynamic CEO. David isleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wineand Spirits in Tennessee.\nAt Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Sales\nare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar\u2019s main competitors.\nAll that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle.\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits arefar below the levels of a few years ago.",
    "home construction, however, continue to struggle.\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits arefar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010compared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400.\nA housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at some\npoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the pasteleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed nextyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. Thesebusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this\nletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nnot needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply coverstheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF\u2019s car loadings far off peak levels, thecompany\u2019s interest coverage was 6:1.\nBoth companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\ninvestments in plant and equipment.",
    "ar loadings far off peak levels, thecompany\u2019s interest coverage was 6:1.\nBoth companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\ninvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn therespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earnreasonable earnings on future capital investments.\nEarlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country\u2019s future. Rail moves 42% of\nAmerica\u2019s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad \u2013 about 28%of the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of allinter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S.\nis transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher.\nAll of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American\neconomy\u2019s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along withits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society\u2019s needs, notmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,with this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I\u2019m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our hugeincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin.\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \u201csocial compact.\u201d We are expected to put up ever-\nincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, weknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\n14\n\nMidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well.",
    "stments.\n14\n\nMidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport\n8% of the country\u2019s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day.\nMidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire\u2019s interest is 89.8%) and its\ncustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\u2019sperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recentreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since we\npurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state hasraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the twoutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told thatcomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area.\nMidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, more\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested orcommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmericanretains allof its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn.\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\nBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican.

CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressedand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010.\nAt Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry\u2019s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peak\nyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would havebeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 reportcontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed throughthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate theprice advantage that manufactured homes offer.\nWe finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore,\nshould be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country\u2019s home-loan practices. Let\u2019s take a look.\nClayton owns 200,804 mortgages that it originated. (It also has some mortgage portfolios that it\npurchased.)

Our share of the\nundistributed earnings of these investees, however, was more than $2 billion last year. These retained earnings\nare important. In our experience \u2013 and, for that matter, in the experience of investors over the past century \u2013undistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains, albeit in a highly irregular manner.(Indeed, sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. As one investor said in 2009: \u201cThis is worse than divorce.I\u2019ve lost half my net worth \u2013 and I still have my wife.\u201d) In the future, we expect our market gains to eventually atleast equal the earnings our investees retain.\n************\nIn our earlier estimate of Berkshire\u2019s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to\nfuture investment income (but did notinclude anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just\ndescribed).\nThe first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these \u2013 our Swiss Renote \u2013 was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others \u2013 our Goldman Sachs and General Electricpreferred stocks \u2013 are likely to be gone by yearend.

(We don\u2019t fault the Fed: Forvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed\u2019s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from justthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, Iwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see our share ofCoke\u2019s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our \u201cnormal\u201d investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.\n************\nLast summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire.

In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates onlybecause his performance made mine look bad.

But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\ngreats. We will miss him.\n************\nFour years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren\u2019t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediatelyavailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.\nIt\u2019s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved iscrucial, as is the manager\u2019s understanding of \u2013 and sensitivity to \u2013 risk (which in no way should be measured bybeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with ahard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,we wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job.\n18\n\nWhen Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met byundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who havereceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with theirlimited partners losing back their earlier gains.

    "r earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly startedanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their pastlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire\u2019s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can resetannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like torequire style boxes such as \u201clong-short,\u201d \u201cmacro,\u201d \u201cinternational equities.\u201d At Berkshire our only style box is\u201csmart.\u201d)\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager\u2019s performance compensation be dependent on his or her ownportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big forindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a usefulperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted \u2013 but not to have a vote \u2013 on thewisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd\u2019s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was \u201clittle-known\u201d and expressed puzzlement that we didn\u2019t seek a \u201cbig-name.\u201d I wonderhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959.

(Whoops \u2013 that may not be the smartestmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)\nDerivatives\nTwo years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives\ncontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over at\nGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and theunwinding or expiration of some contracts.\nOur continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assumingrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions areidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front whenwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That\u2019s important.\nOur first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minorexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\nIn aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an \u201cunderwritingprofit,\u201d meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we wouldbenefit from the use of float.\n19\n\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession.",
    "be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we wouldbenefit from the use of float.\n19\n\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, itappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have hadthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged theright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.\nOur other large derivatives position \u2013 whose contracts go by the name of \u201cequity puts\u201d \u2013 involves\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in theU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&P 500 in the U.S.and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of thesecontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination datecounts: No payments can be required before then.\nAs a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originallyreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.Consequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend.",
    "million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\nThe future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 \u2013and foreign exchange rates are unchanged \u2013 we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to2026. You can call this amount \u201csettlement value.\u201d\nOn our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will recorda $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion andthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability willfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,of course, is far from a sure thing.\nWhat is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining \u201cfloat\u201d of $4.2 billion for an average of about\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance floatfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchaseof BNSF.\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral \u2013 a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged.",
    "ostings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation toour liquid assets.\nFurthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past\n40 years. Instead, we have retained allof our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running\nabout $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those fourdecades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to buildingup its financial strength in this unrelenting way.\nBy being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of\nliquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in oureconomy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival.That\u2019s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30\nth.

James is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. Charlie and I are eagerto expand his managerial domain.\n\u2022 Our major businesses did well last year. In fact, each of our five largest non-insurance companies \u2013 BNSF,\nIscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy \u2013 delivered record operating earnings. Inaggregate these businesses earned more than $9 billion pre-tax in 2011. Contrast that to seven years ago,when we owned only one of the five, MidAmerican, whose pre-tax earnings were $393 million. Unless theeconomy weakens in 2012, each of our fabulous five should again set a record, with aggregate earnings\ncomfortably topping $10 billion.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares.

    "ck repurchases,which will increase our share of the company\u2019s future earnings.\nHad we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the \u201cBig Four\u201d would\nhave been $862 million. That\u2019s all that would have been reported in Berkshire\u2019s income statement. Ourshare of this quartet\u2019s earnings, however, would have been far greater: $3.3 billion. Charlie and Ibelieve that the $2.4 billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value forBerkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. We expect the combined earnings of the four \u2013 andtheir dividends as well \u2013 to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time tocome. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earningsof $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us.\nI\u2019ve run out of good news. Here are some developments that hurt us during 2011:\n\u2022 A few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, an\nelectric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake \u2013 a bigmistake. In large measure,\nthe company\u2019s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase andremains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since ourpurchase, the company\u2019s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. Wewrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year.\nAt yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at present\nlevels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our currentcarrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or evenall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities whenI purchased the bonds.",
    "ubstantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or evenall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities whenI purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman.\n4\n\n\u2022 Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called away from us by their issuers in\n2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeemsecurities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That\u2019s a lot ofincome to replace, though our Lubrizol purchase did offset most of it.\n\u2022 Last year, I told you that \u201ca housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.\u201d I was dead\nwrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. Theconnection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country,accounting for about 7% of those constructed during 2011.\nAdditionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products,\nprimarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. Inaggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That\u2019ssimilar to 2010 but down from $1.8 billion in 2006.\nHousing will come back \u2013 you can be sure of that. Over time, the number of housing units necessarily\nmatches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period ofyears prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, weended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy.That created still another problem for housing: Early in a recession, household formations slow, and in2009 the decrease was dramatic.\nThat devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households\nthan housing units.",
    "in a recession, household formations slow, and in2009 the decrease was dramatic.\nThat devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households\nthan housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormonestake over. And while \u201cdoubling-up\u201d may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living within-laws can quickly lose its allure.\nAt our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts \u2013 considerably less than the number of new\nhouseholds being formed \u2013 buyers and renters are sopping up what\u2019s left of the old oversupply. (Thisprocess will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varieswidely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter,employing only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of theeconomy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in adepression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely\nlagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy.\nWise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don\u2019t\ncreate households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our marketsystem will restore the needed balance \u2013 probably before long. When that day comes, we will againbuild one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how farunemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776:America\u2019s best days lie ahead.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nCharlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic business\nvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks.",
    "d know,however, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets.Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strengththat is unquestionable takes precedence over all else.\n************\nThis discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors\nto changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for twoevents: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time tocome; and second, we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. A corollary to\nthis second point: \u201cTalking our book\u201d about a stock we own \u2013 were that to be effective \u2013 would actually beharmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume.\n6\n\nLet\u2019s use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano\ndid a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Theiroperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.\nBut their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company\u2019s\nfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, askill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, madevalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.\nToday, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.\nNaturally, what happens to the company\u2019s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares.",
    "ally, what happens to the company\u2019s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for theday: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?\nI won\u2019t keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM\u2019s stock price to languish throughout the five years.\nLet\u2019s do the math. If IBM\u2019s stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire\n250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and wewould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-yearperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding afterfive years, of which we would own 6.5%.\nIf IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100\nmillion greater under the \u201cdisappointing\u201d scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higherprice. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $1\n1\u20442billion more than if the \u201chigh-price\u201d\nrepurchase scenario had taken place.\nThe logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own\nmoney or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks\nrise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions , however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance.",
    "s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. Thiscollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322011 70,571\nIt\u2019s unlikely that our float will grow much \u2013 if at all \u2013 from its current level. That\u2019s mainly because we\nalready have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. Were there to be a decline in float, I will add,\nit would almost certainly be very gradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy\nresult creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole tooperate at a significant underwriting loss. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and a well-managed\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years.",
    "a significant underwriting loss. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and a well-managed\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There area lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine\nconsecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue tounderwrite profitably in most \u2013 though certainly not all \u2013 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will bebetter than cost-free. We will profit just as we would if some party deposited $70.6 billion with us, paid us a feefor holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\nSo how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a\nliability in calculating Berkshire\u2019s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable toreplenish it. But that\u2019s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Iffloat is both costless and long-enduring, the true value of this liability is farlower than the accounting liability.\nPartially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d attributable to our insurance\ncompanies that is included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for thefloat-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its\ntrue value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill assetattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case at Berkshire.",
    "business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill assetattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what wewould pay to purchase float of similar quality \u2013 to be far in excess of its historic\ncarrying value. The value of our float is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsicbusiness value substantially exceeds book value.\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry\nas a whole: We don\u2019t think there is much \u201cBerkshire-quality\u201d float existing in the insurance world. In most years,including 2011, the industry\u2019s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\n8\n\nindustry\u2019s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\u2019s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you aboutthe major units.\n************\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire torisks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in that respect than\nmost large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from somemega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anything it has ever faced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record amoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings.",
    "of smaller companies, most of\nthem plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently beenprofitable and the float they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\n9\n\nAt yearend, we acquired Princeton Insurance, a New Jersey writer of medical malpractice policies. This\nbolt-on transaction expands the managerial domain of Tim Kenesey, the star CEO of Medical Protective, our\nIndiana-based med-mal insurer. Princeton brings with it more than $600 million of float, an amount that isincluded in the following table.\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2011 2010 2011 2010\nBH Reinsurance ................ $(714) $ 176 $33,728 $30,370\nGeneral Re .................... 1 4 4 4 5 2 19,714 20,049\nGEICO ....................... 5 7 6 1,117 11,169 10,272\nOther Primary .................. 2 4 2 2 6 8 5,960 5,141\n$ 248 $2,013 $70,571 $65,832\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\u2019s impresses me as the best in the world.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our many other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own sectorin this letter and also split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our\ncredit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amplycovers their interest requirements.

In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF\u2019s interestcoverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under allcircumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and adiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body.\nMeasured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America\u2019s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than\nany other railroad \u2013 about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of allinter-city\nton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as thecirculatory system of our economy. Your railroad is the largest artery.\nAll of this places a huge responsibility on us. We must, without fail, maintain and improve our 23,000\nmiles of track along with 13,000 bridges, 80 tunnels, 6,900 locomotives and 78,600 freight cars. This job requiresus to have ample financial resources under alleconomic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantly\nand effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature, such as the widespread flooding BNSF labored under lastsummer.\nTo fulfill its societal obligation, BNSF regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge, with the\nexcess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays.Though many people decry our country\u2019s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be leviedagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money \u2013 funds from the private sector \u2013 into the investment projects\nneeded to provide better and more extensive service in the future.",
    "sm cannot be leviedagainst the railroad industry.

If railroads were not making these hugeexpenditures, our country\u2019s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion andmaintenance problems than exist today.\nMassive investments of the sort that BNSF is making would be foolish if it could not earn appropriate\nreturns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers.Many years ago Ben Franklin counseled, \u201cKeep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.\u201d Translating this to ourregulated businesses, he might today say, \u201cTake care of your customer, and the regulator \u2013 your customer\u2019srepresentative \u2013 will take care of you.\u201d Good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return.\n10\n\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \u201csocial compact.\u201d We are expected to put up ever-increasing\nsums to satisfy the future needs of our customers.

In contrast, Clayton\u2019s world ofmanufactured housing (just like site-built housing) has endured a veritable depression, experiencing no recoveryto date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in2011. (When housing was booming in 2005, they were 146,744.)\nDespite these difficult times, Clayton has continued to operate profitably, largely because its mortgage\nportfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufacturedhomes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, you might expect us to sufferheavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies \u2013 meaningful downpayments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income \u2013 Clayton has kept losses toacceptable levels. It has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time.\nAs is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price.",
    "ve had negative equity for some time.\nAs is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructivebehavior \u2013 government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly wasthe almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dipswould be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housingtransactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to \u201cmonetize\u201d the increased value of their homes byrefinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemedgreat fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have \u201clost\u201d their house throughforeclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash inexcess of their cost. In these cases, the evicted homeowner was the winner, and the victim was the lender.)\n15\n\nIn 2007, the bubble burst, just as all bubbles must. We are now in the fourth year of a cure that, though\nlong and painful, is sure to succeed. Today, household formations are consistently exceeding housing starts.\nClayton\u2019s earnings should improve materially when the nation\u2019s excess housing inventory is worked\noff. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does notdiffer materially from their book value.\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion.\n12/31/11\nShares CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ............. 13.0 $ 1,287 $ 7,151\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ................ 8 . 8 1,299 13,994\n29,100,937 ConocoPhillips ........................ 2 .",

Concurrently, he is nurturing a huge and attractive underlying business thatwill endure long after today\u2019s problems are forgotten. Our warrants to buy 700 million Bank of America shareswill likely be of great value before they expire.\nAs was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the IBM party. I have\nbeen reading the company\u2019s annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn\u2019t until a Saturday in March lastyear that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you look at that matters, it\u2019s what you see.\u201d\nTodd Combs built a $1.75 billion portfolio (at cost) last year, and Ted Weschler will soon create one of\nsimilar size. Each of them receives 80% of his performance compensation from his own results and 20% from hispartner\u2019s. When our quarterly filings report relatively small holdings, these are not likely to be buys I made(though the media often overlook that point) but rather holdings denoting purchases by Todd or Ted.\n16\n\nOne additional point about these two new arrivals. Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next CEO\nof Berkshire in making acquisitions. They have excellent \u201cbusiness minds\u201d that grasp the economic forces likelyto determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding ofwhat is predictable and what is unknowable.\n************\nThere is little new to report on our derivatives positions, which we have described in detail in past reports.\n(Annual reports since 1977 are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com.)

Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shuncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral.",
    "s, the rules havechanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shuncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. The possibility of some sudden and hugeposting requirement \u2013 arising from an out-of-the-blue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terroristattack \u2013 is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength.\nOur insurance-like derivatives contracts, whereby we pay if various issues included in high-yield bond\nindices default, are coming to a close. The contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired, and theremainder will terminate soon. In 2011, we paid out $86 million on two losses, bringing our total payments to$2.6 billion. We are almost certain to realize a final \u201cunderwriting profit\u201d on this portfolio because the premiumswe received were $3.4 billion, and our future losses are apt to be minor. In addition, we will have averaged about$2 billion of float over the five-year life of these contracts. This successful result during a time of great creditstress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk.\nCharlie and I continue to believe that our equity-put positions will produce a significant profit, considering\nboth the $4.2 billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the $222 million profit we\u2019ve alreadyrealized on contracts that we repurchased. At yearend, Berkshire\u2019s book value reflected a liability of $8.5 billion forthe remaining contracts; if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been $6.2 billion.\nThe Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer\nInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving\nmore money in the future.",
    "2 billion.\nThe Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer\nInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving\nmore money in the future. At Berkshire we take a more demanding approach, defining investing as the transfer toothers of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power \u2013 after taxes\nhave been paid on nominal gains \u2013 in the future. More succinctly, investing is forgoing consumption now in\norder to have the ability to consume more at a later date.\nFrom our definition there flows an important corollary: The riskiness of an investment is notmeasured\nby beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by theprobability \u2013 the reasoned probability \u2013 of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing-power over his\ncontemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonablycertain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a non-fluctuatingasset can be laden with risk.\nInvestment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it\u2019s\nimportant to understand the characteristics of each. So let\u2019s survey the field.\n\u2022 Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages,\nbank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as \u201csafe.\u201dIn truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. Their beta may be zero, but their risk is huge.\nOver the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This uglyresult, moreover, will forever recur.",
    "have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This uglyresult, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemicforces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time suchpolicies spin out of control.\nEven in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86%\nin value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buywhat $1 did at that time. Consequently, a tax-free institution would have needed 4.3% interest annuallyfrom bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers wouldhave been kidding themselves if they thought of anyportion of that interest as \u201cincome.\u201d\n17\n\nFor tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year\nperiod, continuous rolling of U.S. Treasury bills produced 5.7% annually. That sounds satisfactory. Butif an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return wouldhave yielded nothing in the way of real income. This investor\u2019s visible income tax would have stripped\nhim of 1.4 points of the stated yield, and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining4.3 points. It\u2019s noteworthy that the implicit inflation \u201ctax\u201d was more than triple the explicit income taxthat our investor probably thought of as his main burden. \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d may be imprinted on ourcurrency, but the hand that activates our government\u2019s printing press has been all too human.\nHigh interest rates, of course, can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currency-based\ninvestments \u2013 and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not comeclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume.",
    "e a favorite ofsuch buyers in the 17\nthcentury.\nThis type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they\nbelieve the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are notinspired by what the asset itself can\nproduce \u2013 it will remain lifeless forever \u2013 but rather by the belief that others will desire it even moreavidly in the future.\nThe major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other\nassets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however,has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has someindustrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable ofsoaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will stillown one ounce at its end.\nWhat motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the\npast decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generatedadditional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.As \u201cbandwagon\u201d investors join any party, they create their own truth \u2013 for a while .\nOver the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses\nthat can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In thesebubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the \u201cproof\u201d delivered by the market,and the pool of buyers \u2013 for a time \u2013 expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubblesblown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: \u201cWhat the wiseman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.\u201d\n18\n\nToday the world\u2019s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons.",

For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire\u2019s percentage increase in book value was less\nthan the S&P\u2019s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). Ineight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&P had a gain of 15% or more. We do better when thewind is in our face.\nTo date, we\u2019ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the\nS&P over such a stretch.

If we do so, Berkshire\u2019s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itselfoutpace the S&P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, whothemselves can earn S&P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.\nCharlie and I believe the gain in Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value will over time likely surpass the S&P returns bya small margin. We\u2019re confident of that because we have some outstanding businesses, a cadre of terrificoperating managers and a shareholder-oriented culture. Our relative performance, however, is almostcertain to be better when the market is down or flat. In years when the market is particularly strong, expectus to fall short.\n\u0160The second disappointment in 2012 was my inability to make a major acquisition. I pursued a couple ofelephants, but came up empty-handed.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nOur luck, however, changed early this year. In February, we agreed to buy 50% of a holding company that\nwill own all of H. J. Heinz. The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge PauloLemann, a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist.\nWe couldn\u2019t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinarymanager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holdingcompany. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferredhas two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significantpremium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holdingcompany\u2019s common stock for a nominal sum.\nOur total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year.",

But we stillhave plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip. So it\u2019s back to work; Charlie and I have againdonned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants.\nNow to some good news from 2012:\n\u0160Last year I told you that BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy \u2013 our five most\nprofitable non-insurance companies \u2013 were likely to earn more than $10 billion pre-tax in 2012. Theydelivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our\u201cpowerhouse five\u201d had aggregate earnings of $10.1 billion, about $600 million more than in 2011.\nOf this group, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire eight years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased theamount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simplygrowing, but rather increasing per-share results.\nUnless the U.S. economy tanks \u2013 which we don\u2019t expect \u2013 our powerhouse five should again deliver higher\nearnings in 2013. The five outstanding CEOs who run them will see to that.\n\u0160Though I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We hada record year for \u201cbolt-on\u201d purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded intoour existing businesses.",

Our headquarters crew, however, remained unchanged at 24. No sense going crazy.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo \u2013 all had goodyears. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchasedadditional shares of Wells Fargo (our ownership now is 8.7% versus 7.6% at yearend 2011) and IBM (6.0%versus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentageownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from13.0% to 13.7%.\nBerkshire\u2019s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future.

At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us asignificant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate.\nGoing by our yearend share count, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2012 earnings amounted to $3.9 billion.\nIn the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.1 billion.But make no mistake: The $2.8 billion of earnings we do not report is every bit as valuable to us as whatwe record.\nThe earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases \u2013 which enhance our share of\nfuture earnings \u2013 and also for funding business opportunities that are usually advantageous. Over time weexpect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshirewill increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled$26.7 billion at yearend).\n\u0160There was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried \u201cuncertainty\u201d when faced with capital-allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings andcash).

That\u2019s 19% more than we spent in 2011, ourprevious high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits aresaying.

Opportunities abound in America.\n************\nA thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced theunknown since 1776. It\u2019s just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always existwhile at other times they ignore them (usually because the recent past has been uneventful).\n5\n\nAmerican business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied\nto business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game thatis heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20\nth\nCentury, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression andmany recessions. And don\u2019t forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the centuryas well.)\nSince the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it\u2019s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out\nof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of \u201cexperts,\u201d or the ebb and flow of businessactivity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.\nMy own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when\nthe U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day\u2019s headlines told of moresetbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail.\nThe country\u2019s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per\ncapita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been\nuncertain.",
    "ire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322012 73,125\nLast year I told you that our float was likely to level off or even decline a bit in the future. Our insurance\nCEOs set out to prove me wrong and did, increasing float last year by $2.5 billion. I now expect a further increase\nin 2013. But further gains will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\u2019s float will almost certainly grow. InNational Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 2% in any year.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. That\u2019s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay youinterest.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011.",
    "try pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Theirfinancials for 2012 are not yet available.) There are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry neverceases searching for new ones.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. If we do, our float will be better than free money.\nSo how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is\ncalculated, the fullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were\nunable to replenish it. But that\u2019s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolvingfund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire\u2019s will be, the true value of this liability isdramatically less than the accounting liability.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true\nvalue. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill assetcarried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\n7\n\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance\ngoodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality \u2013t ob e\nfar in excess of its historic carrying value.",

The value of our float is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believeBerkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: There is very little \u201cBerkshire-quality\u201d float existing in the insurance world. In 37 of the 45 years ending in2011, the industry\u2019s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry\u2019soverall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by Americanindustry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.\nA further unpleasant reality adds to the industry\u2019s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting\nfrom \u201clegacy\u201d bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvestedduring the next few years \u2013 and perhaps for many years beyond that. Today\u2019s bond portfolios are, in effect, wastingassets. Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some\nextraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no\none else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportant, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers.",

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude somepurchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in thismanner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the real expenses and profits ofthe businesses aggregated in the table.\nI won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are small and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should\nunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such asthe amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realexpenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded asexpenses when calculating earnings \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpoint they could not be more different.\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $600 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal\u201d \u2013 and indeedthat is the portion we have included in the table above \u2013 and the rest not.

    "ernet.\n17\n\nOur confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger\u2019s outstanding management group at the\nOmaha World-Herald , a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers,\nhowever, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailiesthat endorsed a presidential candidate, 10 opted for Romney.)\nOur newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward.\nStill, the six small dailies we owned throughout 2012 had unchanged revenues for the year, a result far superior tothat experienced by big-city dailies. Moreover, the two large papers we operated throughout the year \u2013 The Buffalo\nNews and the Omaha World-Herald \u2013 held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.\nAmong newspapers in America\u2019s 50 largest metropolitan areas, our Buffalo and Omaha papers rank near the top incirculation penetration of their home territories.\nThis popularity is no accident: Credit the editors of those papers \u2013 Margaret Sullivan at the News and Mike\nReilly at the World-Herald \u2014 for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable to\ncommunity-interested readers. (Margaret, I regret to say, recently left us to join The New York Times , whose job\noffers are tough to turn down. That paper made a great hire, and we wish her the best.)\nBerkshire\u2019s cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensible\nInternet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meetor exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief.\nCharlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not\ncontinue the operation of anybusiness doomed to unending losses.",
    "hey would be if the funds we used for\nacquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.\nBut, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That\u2019s particularly\ntrue at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is nowmore difficult than it has been during most of our years.\nNevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF is\na case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the fundsrequired for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though largetransactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.\nThe third use of funds \u2013 repurchases \u2013 is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful\ndiscount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds\nintelligently: It\u2019s hard to go wrong when you\u2019re buying dollar bills for 80\u00a2 or less. We explained our criteria forrepurchases in last year\u2019s report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. Weoriginally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, weincreased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value.\n19\n\nBut never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are\nmade above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningfulway by purchases up to our 120% limit.\nAnd that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The\nnumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends.",
    ", though certainly not assured.\nMoreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the\nargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshire\u2019s history \u2013 admittedly one that won\u2019t comeclose to being repeated \u2013 the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramatically superior to\nthe dividend policy.\nAside from the favorable math, there are two further \u2013 and important \u2013 arguments for a sell-off policy.\nFirst, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, thosewho wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. Itis safe to say, however, that a great many of them \u2013 perhaps even most of them \u2013 are in a net-savings mode andlogically should prefer no payment at all.\n20\n\nThe sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receipts\nand capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholderselect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use hisdividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also paya 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take placeat 125% of book value.)\nThe second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior \u2013 usually farinferior \u2013 to those under the sell-off program.",
    "The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior \u2013 usually farinferior \u2013 to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend\nprogram, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax ononly the gain portion of the cash receipts.\nLet me end this math exercise \u2013 and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill \u2013 by using my\nown case to illustrate how a shareholder\u2019s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased\ninvestment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 4\n1\u20444%o fm yB e r k s h i r e\nshares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) hasdecreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentage of the company has significantly decreased.\nYet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in\nBerkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figuresare $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have farmore money working for me\nat Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It\u2019s also true that my share ofboth Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value and the company\u2019s normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005.Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue \u2013 albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion \u2013 even as I nowannually give away more than 4\n1\u20442% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I\u2019ve recently doubled my\nlifetime pledges to certain foundations).\n************\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\nconfuse owners and drive away would-be investors.",
    "me pledges to certain foundations).\n************\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\nconfuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of hisCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits , a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition\nofSecurity Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a\nrestaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can\u2019t switchcapriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.\nMost companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very\nreluctantly. Our \u201cBig Four\u201d portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certaincases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.\nWe applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and\nwe love repurchases at appropriate prices.\nAt Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible\nand that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policyas long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable.If the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 4that the CenturyLink Center.

Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2013 was $34.2 billion.

    "will explain later \u2013 that arose from our purchase of the minorityinterests in Marmon and Iscar. After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stockincreased by 18.2%. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grownfrom $19 to $134,973, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\nOn the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change in\nBerkshire\u2019s per-share book value versus the market performance of the S&P 500. What counts, of course, is per-share intrinsic value. But that\u2019s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (An\nextended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108.Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders toread them.)\nAs I\u2019ve long told you, Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference has\nwidened considerably in recent years. That\u2019s why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at 120%of book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic valueexceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however,because the stock price did not descend to the 120% level. If it does, we will be aggressive.\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire\u2019s book value and\nintrinsic value will outperform the S&P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fallshort, though, in years when the market is strong \u2013 as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49years, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S&P gain exceeded 15%.\nOver the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through full\ncycles in future years, we expect to do that again.",

Through full\ncycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, youcould always own an index fund and be assured of S&P results.\nThe Year at Berkshire\nOn the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year \u2013 in certain cases very well.\nLet me count the ways:\n\u0160We completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and amajor interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.\nWith the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire in\nfuture acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, JorgePaulo Lemann. His talented associates \u2013 Bernardo Hees, Heinz\u2019s new CEO, and Alex Behring, itsChairman \u2013 are responsible for operations.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nBerkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock that\ncarries a 9% coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred\u2019s annual return to12% or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $4.25 billion.\nThough the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a \u201cprivate equity\u201d transaction, there is a crucial\ndifference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times.",
    "e company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that itwould be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at anequity valuation appropriate to the time).\nOur partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minor\nearnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time chargesincurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014will be substantial.\nWith Heinz, Berkshire now owns 8\n1\u20442companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in the\nFortune 500. Only 4911\u20442to go.\nNV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity\nto about 88% of Nevada\u2019s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utilityoperation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will notbe\nMidAmerican\u2019s last major acquisition.\n\u0160MidAmerican is one of our \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d \u2013 a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, inaggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The othercompanies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution.",
    "thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfiesour goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-share results.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five toimprove also \u2013 perhaps by $1 billion or so pre-tax.\n\u0160Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9billion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 \u2013 that makes 11years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float \u2013 money that doesn\u2019t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion.Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million .\nWe now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurerBerkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICOin 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recentlypassed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service.

These transactionsranged from $1.9 million to $1.1 billion in size.\nCharlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses\nand that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and moreearnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will bemeaningful.\n\u0160Last year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in twowonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case \u2013 Marmon \u2013 our purchases brought us to the100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance \u2013 Iscar \u2013 the Wertheimer familyelected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we boughtcontrol in 2006.\nThese purchases added about $300 million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $800\nmillion of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year\u2019s letterrequired that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process thatreduced Berkshire\u2019s book value. (The charge was made to \u201ccapital in excess of par value\u201d; figure thatone\nout.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire\u2019s excess of intrinsicvalue over book value by the same $1.8 billion.\n\u0160Our subsidiaries spent a record $11 billion on plant and equipment during 2013, roughly twice ourdepreciation charge. About 89% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we invest abroad aswell, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.\n\u0160In a year in which most equity managers found it impossible to outperform the S&P 500, both ToddCombs and Ted Weschler handily did so.

Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s yearend employment \u2013 counting Heinz \u2013 totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year.The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don\u2019t panic: Theheadquarters gang still fits comfortably on one floor.)\n\u0160Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasingour ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stockrepurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if youthink tenths of a percent aren\u2019t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, eachincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire\u2019s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.\n5\n\nThe four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented.",
    "heir equity raises Berkshire\u2019s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.\n5\n\nThe four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the Hopediamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nGoing by our yearend holdings, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2013 earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. In\nthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.4 billion lastyear. But make no mistake: The $3 billion of their earnings we don\u2019t report is every bit as valuable to us asthe portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move\nthat enhances our share of future earnings \u2013 as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turnout to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees willgrow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important,our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion atyearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: \u201cThe advantage of being bi-sexual is that itdoubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.\u201d Similarly, our appetite for either operating businesses\nor passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire\u2019s history.",

As we view these and other strengths,Charlie and I like your company\u2019s prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\n6\n\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid outthe three elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to\n$129,253 and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 12.8% to $9,116per share.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and our\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-yearperiod has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains inboth sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof).

Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\u2019t get any ideas!)\nInsurance\n\u201cOur investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a more\ndiversified base of earning power.\u201d\n\u2014 1967 Annual Report\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled our\nexpansion since that 1967 report was published.\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\nas those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims comeand go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322013 77,240\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\u2019s float will almost certainly grow.\nIn National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate\ndemands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources.",
    "l \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate\ndemands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurancediffers in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)\n7\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latestyear for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry \u2013 despite the float income all companies enjoy \u2013 will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns as compared to other businesses.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eleven\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers who\nknow that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it.",
    "r float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims \u2013some $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 \u2013 and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each daywrite new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless andlong-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting\nliability.\nA counterpart to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on\nits true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwillasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar\nquality to that we have \u2013 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason \u2013 a\nhuge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain.",
    "ntees that legitimate claims arising many years in the futurewill be paid promptly and fully.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with manyFortune 500 companies and with smaller operations as well. BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that willgenerate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annualmeeting.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit afterboth prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We areparticularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistentlyand profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that\ncaused commentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake.",

The \u201ccustomer\u201d pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future if certain events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay \u2013 even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives \u2013 is all-important.\nBerkshire\u2019s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world\u2019s largest\nand most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to \u201ccede\u201d their liabilitiesto a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however \u2013 one that down the road proved to be financially strapped ora bad actor \u2013 would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.\nAlmost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest such\ntransaction ever recorded, Lloyd\u2019s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising frompolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materializein the future.",

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accountingitems (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlieand I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businessesaggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.\n13\n\nI won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. Withsoftware, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as theamortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realcosts. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenseswhen earnings are calculated \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpoint they could not be more different.\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $648 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not.This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made.",
    "ompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not.This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. It will almost certainly risefurther as we acquire more companies.\nEventually, of course, the non-real charges disappear when the assets to which they\u2019re related become\nfully amortized. But this usually takes 15 years and \u2013 alas \u2013 it will be my successor whose reported earnings get thebenefit of their expiration.\nEvery dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that\u2019s true at almost all other\ncompanies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality,\nhowever, remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\n************\nThe crowd of companies in this section sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of\nthese businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing\nprofits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.A few, however, have very poor returns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. Iwas not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry inwhich it operated.\nFortunately, my blunders usually involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, however, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business.",
    "ave not, however, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an\naverage of $25 billion of net tangible assets during 2013 and, with large quantities of excess cash and littleleverage, earned 16.7% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive.\nWe have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carryingvalue by a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance andregulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, both current\nand potential competitors read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if they knew ournumbers. So, in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we onlydisclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations, however, on pages 80-84.\n14\n\nI can\u2019t resist, however, giving you an update on Nebraska Furniture Mart\u2019s expansion into Texas.

I\u2019m not\ncovering this event because of its economic importance to Berkshire \u2013 it takes more than a new store to move the\nneedle on Berkshire\u2019s $225 billion equity base. But I\u2019ve now worked 30 years with the marvelous Blumkin family,and I\u2019m excited about the remarkable store \u2013 truly Texas-sized \u2013 it is building at The Colony, in the northern part ofthe Dallas metropolitan area.\nWhen the store is completed next year, NFM will have \u2013 under one roof, and on a 433-acre site \u2013 1.8 million\nsquare feet of retail and supporting warehouse space. View the project\u2019s progress at www.nfm.com/texas. NFMalready owns the two highest-volume home furnishings stores in the country (in Omaha and Kansas City, Kansas),each doing about $450 million annually. I predict the Texas store will blow these records away. If you live anywherenear Dallas, come check us out.\nI think back to August 30, 1983 \u2013 my birthday \u2013 when I went to see Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin), carrying a\n1\n1\u20444-page purchase proposal for NFM that I had drafted. (It\u2019s reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted my\noffer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers orlawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company\u2019s financial statements wereunaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.\nMrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 \u2013 definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM\u2019s\nfinancial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $72,264 of networth and $50 \u2013 nozeros omitted \u2013 of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B,\nher son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.\nThe punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school. Moreover, she emigrated from\nRussia to America knowing not a word of English. But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs.",

But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs. B\u2019s request, thefamily always sang God Bless America at its gatherings.\nAspiring business managers should look hard at the plain, but rare, attributes that produced Mrs. B\u2019s\nincredible success. Students from 40 universities visit me every year, and I have them start the day with a visit toNFM. If they absorb Mrs. B\u2019s lessons, they need none from me.\nFinance and Financial Products\n\u201cClayton\u2019s loan portfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in not too many years and, with sensible\ncredit standards in place, should deliver significant earnings.\u201d\n\u2014 2003 Annual Report\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well as\nClayton Homes, the country\u2019s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest inBerkadia Commercial Mortgage.\nClayton is placed in this section because it owns and services 326,569 mortgages, totaling $13.6 billion. In\nrecent years, as manufactured home sales plummeted, a high percentage of Clayton\u2019s earnings came from thismortgage business.\nIn 2013, however, the sale of new homes began to pick up and earnings from both manufacturing and\nretailing are again becoming significant. Clayton remains America\u2019s number one homebuilder: Its 2013 output of29,547 homes accounted for about 4.7% of all single-family residences built in the country.

    "t you are considering. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable making a roughestimate of the asset\u2019s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate everyinvestment possibility. But omniscience isn\u2019t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.\n\u0160If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating.There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and Iam skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their firsttoss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that\na given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.\n\u0160With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all\nabout their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field \u2013 not by thosewhose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stockprices, give it a try on weekdays.\n\u0160Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time.Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hearTV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle\u2019sscathing comment: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.\u201d)\n18\n\n\u0160My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993.

I can\u2019t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever thechatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.\nThere is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks\nprovide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farmor the New York real estate.\nIt should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations\nplaced on their holdings \u2013 and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering myproperty yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his \u2013 and those pricesvaried widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state \u2013 how in the world could I be other thanbenefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I wouldbuy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\nOwners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners\ncause them to behave irrationally as well.",
    "as were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek\nletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.\n20\n\nA couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing an\nunnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the firstedition and \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities ofGEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire\u2019s would have been far different.\nThe 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $17 and earning\nabout $10 per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leavinghimself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time thatrequired the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.\nThe recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlington\nand Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fullyowned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $40 million. Now itssuccessor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earns that amount every four days.\nI can\u2019t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor . Whatever the cost, it would\nunderscore the truth of Ben\u2019s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get.",

Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm thatwas born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pensionmathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.\nInvestment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to\nKatharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and theimportance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.\nDuring the next decade, you will read a lot of news \u2013 badnews \u2013 about public pension plans. I hope my\nmemo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3\nrdat the CenturyLink Center.

The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)\nWe will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will\nbe Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt ofRuane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.\nAnd we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire. We would like to hear from applicants who are\nshort Berkshire (please include evidence of your position). The three analysts will bring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information\nsimultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That\u2019s why we try to issue financial informationlate on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays.",
    "simultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That\u2019s why we try to issue financial informationlate on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-oneto large institutional investors or analysts, but rather treat allshareholders the same. Our hope is that the journalists\nand analysts will ask questions that further educate our owners about their investment.\n23\n\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is someextra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 15 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\nStars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Mosthave no financial need to work; the joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much to them as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office.",

Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered inketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.\nIn closing, I think it\u2019s become appropriate to ignore our \u201cno pictures\u201d policy and let you view our\nremarkable home-office crew.

Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nA note to readers: Fifty years ago, today\u2019s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary,\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50years and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what theother had written. Warren\u2019s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie\u2019s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly newones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*\nDuring our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change in\nBerkshire\u2019s per-share book value. We\u2019ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\nIn our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\nnow.",
    "but useful, tracking device\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\nIn our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\nnow. That was true because Berkshire\u2019s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restatedto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of bookvalue were \u201cmarked to market.\u201d\nToday, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these\nare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how\nmuch the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and itsbook value has materially widened.\nWith that in mind, we have added a new set of data \u2013 the historical record of Berkshire\u2019s stock price \u2013 to\nthe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.Monthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairmanand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire\u2019s per-shareintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company\u2019sshares.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one.",
    "sed in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:\n\u2039Our \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d \u2013 a collection of Berkshire\u2019s largest non-insurance businesses \u2013 had a record $12.4\nbillion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group areBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I\u2019ve called it Iscar in the past),Lubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.\nSubsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire bythe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies ourgoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve\nas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that havealready closed or are under contract.\n\u2039Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During theyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures canbadly hurt their businesses.\nBNSF is, by far, Berkshire\u2019s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we\nwill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015.",
    "in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float \u2013 money thatdoesn\u2019t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $84billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\u2019s earnings, floatgenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.\n* Throughout this letter, as well as in the \u201cGolden Anniversary\u201d letters included later in this report, all earnings are\nstated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\n4\n\nMeanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billion\nearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million .\n\u2039While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on\nacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, thelargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed underMarmon\u2019s jurisdiction.\nCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren\u2019t.) They deploy\ncapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expertmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularlyappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.\n\u2039Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in theacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnershipwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint.",
    "h-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that areoutstanding.\nIn recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. There\nare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by therelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire\u2019s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers towelcome further purchases by us. If we do this \u2013 and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices \u2013 we willbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl\u2019s $9 billion of sales.\nWith the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 9\n1\u20442companies that would be listed on the Fortune\n500 were they independent (Heinz is the1\u20442). That leaves 4901\u20442fish in the sea. Our lines are out.\n5\n\n\u2039Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice their\ndepreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will alwaysinvest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have beenuncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born inthe United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has givenus.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s yearend employees \u2013 including those at Heinz \u2013 totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from lastyear. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sensegoing crazy.\n\u2039Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo.

Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, AmericanExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each.",
    "tional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, AmericanExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership ofWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren\u2019t important, ponder thismath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raisesBerkshire\u2019s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the HopeDiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nIf Berkshire\u2019s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2014 earnings\nbefore discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.6 billion lastyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion ofthese companies\u2019 earnings we don\u2019t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move that\nenhances Berkshire\u2019s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retainedearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar).",
    "us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gainsmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capitalgains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding\nsensible uses for Berkshire\u2019s endless gusher of cash.\n\u2039I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investmentexperience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other.And some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed\u2019s wonderful book, Where\nAre the Customers\u2019 Yachts? , a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a\ncaption says, \u201cThere are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words orpictures.\u201d If you haven\u2019t read Schwed\u2019s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor aretruly priceless.)\n6\n\nAmong Arno\u2019s \u201ccertain things,\u201d I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and the\nmanagement of businesses. I therefore think it\u2019s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our twoinvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics.",
    "sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.\nI\u2019ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the very\nlimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of workand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to sayamong the best).\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire\u2019s history. At the time, I called the transaction an \u201call-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.\u201d\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We\u2019ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a\u201cbet\u201d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting against America? If you compare our\ncountry\u2019s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real\nper-capita U.S. output has sextupled . My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.\nThough the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America\u2019s problems, I\u2019ve never seen one who wishes toemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).\nThe dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won\u2019t come in a\nsmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government.",
    "e\u2019s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has\npropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution wassimplicity itself.\nJack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to my\noffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack\u2019s companies had ever had anaudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn\u2019t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also abit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.\nOn pages 128-129, we reproduce the 1\n1\u20442-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction.\nThat contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire\u2019s best deal: NationalIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds thatof any other insurer in the world.\nOne reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C\ninsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certainworkers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount offloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322014 83,921\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve.",

On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercial\ninsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, isparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, itwill be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that\nwe can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strength\nis a key pillar in Berkshire\u2019s economic fortress.\n8\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of lowinterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profitproblems of the industry.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years.",
    "ed at an underwriting profit for\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers,\nwho know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message isgiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount\nof our float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think\nof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claimsand related expenses \u2013 a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 \u2013 and that reduces float. Justas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing\non its true value.",
    "e. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing\non its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any\ngoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it \u2013 to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with\nwhich we agree) this excess value will never be entered on our books. But I can assure you that it\u2019s real. That\u2019s one\nreason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings.",
    "r expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 andonly a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by\ninsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.\n10\n\nGEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. (We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) Thecompany\u2019s low costs create a moat \u2013 an enduring one \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires\nof telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularlyendearing quality \u2013 he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from hisfame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion fromunderwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies andtheir managers.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2014 2013 2014 2013\nBH Reinsurance .................................... $ 6 0 6 $1,294 $42,454 $37,231\nGeneral Re ......................................... 2 7 7 2 8 3 19,280 20,013\nGEICO ............................................ 1,159 1,127 13,569 12,566\nOther Primary ...................................... 6 2 6 3 8 5 8,618 7,430\n$2,668 $3,089 $83,921 $77,240\n************\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises.",

The \u201ccustomer\u201d pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives, is all-important.\nBerkshire\u2019s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world\u2019s largest and\nmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.That is, these insurers wished to \u201ccede\u201d these liabilities \u2013 most of them potential losses from asbestos claims \u2013 to areinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hookfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatensthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.\nLast year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billion\nsingle premium. I believe that the policy\u2019s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd\u2019s, inwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.\nIn fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And,\nyes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50years or more from now.",
    "dPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout theworld for decades to come.\nBHE can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. In fact, last year the company\nretained more dollars of earnings \u2013 by far \u2013 than any other American electric utility. We and ourregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage \u2013 one almost certain to distinguishBHE from other utilities for many years to come.\nWhen BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company\u2019s renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.\n12\n\nLast year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our rates\nremain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.\nThe story at BNSF, however \u2013 as I noted earlier \u2013 was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad\ndisappointed many of its customers.",
    "record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.\nThe story at BNSF, however \u2013 as I noted earlier \u2013 was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad\ndisappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF hasmade in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.\nThe two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably more\nfreight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific\u2019s last year, andwe lost market share as a result. Moreover, U.P.\u2019s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot ofwork to do.\nWe are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving our\nrailroad\u2019s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as theindustry\u2019s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentagecompares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.\u2019s projection for the near future of 16-17%.

    "ta conforming to GAAP is on page 49. In contrast, the operating expense\nfigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certainintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers moreaccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAPfigures.\nI won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For\nsoftware, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges againstother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accountingrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpointthey could not be more different.\n14\n\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not. The \u201cnon-real\u201d charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\nThe GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have\n$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even iftrue earnings are flat.\nDepreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report\nis a real cost.",
    "investment if it is bought for too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed inthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a goodmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value inboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors \u2013 both current and potential \u2013 read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers.

You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations,however, on pages 97-100.\n15\n\nFinance and Financial Products\nThis year we include in this section Marmon\u2019s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars,\ncontainers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? Atone time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of thecompany\u2019s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gainmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon\u2019s leasing operations under this heading.",
    "ture of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improvedpricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleetconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.\nOne further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we\nmanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book anyprofit when we transfer\ncars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a\u201cbargain\u201d price. The difference between that figure and a \u201cretail\u201d price is only slowly reflected in our earningsthrough smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact aswell as others, Marmon\u2019s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on ourbooks.\nHere\u2019s the earnings recap for this sector:\n2014\n2013 2012\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share) ............. $ 1 2 2 $ 8 0 $ 3 5\nClayton ............................... 5 5 8 4 1 6 2 5 5\nCORT ................................ 3 6 4 0 4 2\nMarmon \u2013 Containers and Cranes ..... 2 3 8 2 2 6 2 4 6\nMarmon \u2013 Railcars .................... 4 4 2 3 5 3 2 9 9\nXTRA ................................ 1 4 7 1 2 5 1 0 6\nNet financial income* ................. 2 9 6 3 2 4 4 1 0\n$ 1,839 $ 1,564 $ 1,393\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n16\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.\n12/31/14\nShares** CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ................. 14.8 $ 1,287 $ 14,106\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .................... 9 . 2 1,299 16,888\n18,513,482 DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. ............. 8 . 6 8 4 3 1,402\n15,430,586 Deere & Company .......................... 4 .",

Thatlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy forrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is farfrom\nsynonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.\nIt is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and\npurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors \u2013 say,investment banks \u2013 whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sellsecurities during depressed markets.

The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9 a.m. to 4\np.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded our salesin all of December, normally a jeweler\u2019s best month.\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27\nththrough Saturday, May 9th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows youare a Berkshire holder.\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will\nbewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world\u2019s top bridgeexperts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don\u2019t play them for money.\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\nAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she\u2019s a sophomore atPrinceton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don\u2019t mind embarrassingyourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.\nGorat\u2019s and Piccolo\u2019s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3\nrd.\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\u2019s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\u2019s opening at 4 p.m.",

Only sissies get the small one.\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains theexpert on\nbusiness and financial matters, and who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, atBerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\ninteresting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them.

Our hope is that the analysts andjournalists will ask questions that add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\n21\n\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from eachanalyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from theaudience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annualmeeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, adrawing.\nWhile I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also haveadequate time to analyze it. That\u2019s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and whyour annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders.\n************\nWe get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses who\nwant you to enjoy yourselves.

Airbnb\u2019s services may beespecially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year afew hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tightbudget should check the Airbnb website.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\nStars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies.Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much tothem as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federalincome tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\u2019s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019sactivities \u2013 and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered inHeinz ketchup, of course) for lunch.",

They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered inHeinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.\nLast year, for the annual report, we dropped our 48-year-old \u201cno pictures\u201d policy \u2013 who says I\u2019m not\nflexible? \u2013 and ran a photo of our remarkable home-office crew that was taken at our Christmas lunch.

BuffettChairman of the Board\n22\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nACQUISITION CRITERIA\nWe are eager to hear from principals or their representatives about businesses that meet all of the following criteria:\n(1) Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units),\n(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are \u201cturnaround\u201d situations),(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,(4) Management in place (we can\u2019t supply it),(5) Simple businesses (if there\u2019s lots of technology, we won\u2019t understand it),(6) An offering price (we don\u2019t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction\nwhen price is unknown).\nThe larger the company, the greater will be our interest: We would like to make an acquisition in the $5-20 billion range. We\nare not interested, however, in receiving suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock market.\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.",
    "d, however, no more could be expected.\nBerkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set\nout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of ouroriginal purchases. There it was \u2013 my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for otherdiscarded butts.\nInstead, irritated by Stanton\u2019s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire\nshares.\n24\n\nBy April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board\nmeeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury\u2019s and my childish behavior \u2013 after all, whatwas an eighth of a point to either of us? \u2013 he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL\u2019s capitalinvested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.\nBecause of Berkshire\u2019s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had\nfallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by thetextile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire\u2019s 1964 annual reportis reproduced on pages 130-142.)\nFor a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet,\nits earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisenfrom the disastrous results in earlier years.\nThen the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the\ntextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness \u2013 stupidity? \u2013 has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation.\n************\nUndeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL\u2019s resources to a dying business, I quickly\ncompounded the error.",
    ". In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation.\n************\nUndeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL\u2019s resources to a dying business, I quickly\ncompounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the mostcostly in my career.\nEarly in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), a small but\npromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweetspot: I understood and liked the industry.\nJack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me \u2013 me, personally. In\nno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I\u2019vehad 48 years to think about that question, and I\u2019ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossalmistake.\nIf BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to\nform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impededfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequentacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by thelegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I optedto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decisionthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.\n************\nOne more confession and then I\u2019ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought\nWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a \u201cbargain\u201d based on theassets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire\u2019s existing textile business.",
    "tive as short-term\ninvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriagepartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been ahighly satisfactory \u201cdate\u201d: If we had taken Seabury Stanton\u2019s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL\u2019s weighted annualreturn on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)\n************\nIt took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could\ncombine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and asa youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather\u2019s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, longafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor whointroduced us predicted that we would hit it off \u2013 and we did.\nIf you\u2019ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious\nmemory, and some firm opinions. I\u2019m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don\u2019t agree. In 56 years,however, we\u2019ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: \u201cWarren,think it over and you\u2019ll agree with me because you\u2019re smart and I\u2019m right.\u201d\nWhat most of you do notknow about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began\nhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today \u2013 some 55 years later.",
    "hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today \u2013 some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can\u2019t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recentyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,is working on another major project.\nFrom my perspective, though, Charlie\u2019s most important architectural feat was the design of today\u2019s\nBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderfulprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.\n26\n\nAltering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without\nCharlie\u2019s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when \u2013 ahem \u2013 I\nhad attended three ). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his\nlogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie\u2019s blueprint. My role has been that of generalcontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.\nThe year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part \u2013\nremember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See\u2019s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.\nSee\u2019s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning\nabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a hugeasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significantpricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See\u2019s major gains in earnings over time.",
    "Today\nBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.\nConglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly\ndeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why theconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.\nSince I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the\nsilliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,promotion or dubious accounting \u2013 and often by all three \u2013 these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate\u2019s stockto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-sotimes earnings. They immediately applied \u201cpooling\u201d accounting to the acquisition, which \u2013 with not a dime\u2019s worthof change in the underlying businesses \u2013 automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof ofmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even theenhancement, of the acquirer\u2019s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure andthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.\nWall Street\u2019s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street\u2019s denizens are\nalways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willinglysprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates\u2019 accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how tofurther juice the numbers.",
    "as having found amanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.\n29\n\nEventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, it\nbecame evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares \u2013 just like chain-lettermodels \u2013 most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodicallyblossom in our country \u2013 they are every promoter\u2019s dream \u2013 though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise.The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters,the sums hijacked can be staggering.\nAt both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That\nbehavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that isoverpriced and \u2013 all too often \u2013 outright dishonesty.\n************\nSo what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire\u2019s conglomerate structure? To put the case\nsimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capitalgrowth.\nOne of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets\nwill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all itsexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.\nNevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire\nminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed fordecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements.",
    "oreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject topressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That\u2019s important: If horses hadcontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\n30\n\nAnother major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses \u2013 a.k.a. common\nstocks. That\u2019s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative hasproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offeredby the stock market every day \u2013 in small pieces, to be sure \u2013 are often far more attractive than the businesses we areconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we\u2019ve realized from marketable securities havehelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.\nIn effect, the world is Berkshire\u2019s oyster \u2013 a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those\nrealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we canevaluate. And that\u2019s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like tenyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has beenconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a farlarger size than the many businesses\nthat are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.\nI mentioned earlier that See\u2019s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital\nrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. Butour many attempts to do so were largely futile.",
    "sating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company willflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracyof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)\nIf the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be\nurged by its bankers to pay a hefty \u201ccontrol\u201d premium for the privilege. (Mental \u201cflexibility\u201d of this sort by thebanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading tofees.)\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.\nBerkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divesta bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.\n32\n\nVoluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation\nflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now wouldhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantagesderived from Berkshire\u2019s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likelyincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.\n************\nBefore I depart the subject of spin-offs, let\u2019s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned\nearlier: LTV. I\u2019ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about JimmyLing that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine . Look it up on the Internet.\nThrough a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to\nnumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself.",
    "n the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had nopeer in that respect.\nLing\u2019s strategy, which he labeled \u201cproject redeployment,\u201d was to buy a large company and then partially\nspin off its various divisions. In LTV\u2019s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: \u201cMostimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.\u201d The press, the public and WallStreet loved this sort of talk.\nIn 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and\npharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson SportingGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly becameknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.\nSoon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s,\nLing\u2019s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.\nPeriodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality \u2013 you can count on that. More Jimmy\nLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers willfight for their business. What they are saying will recently have \u201cworked.\u201d Their early followers will be feeling veryclever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4.",
    "t Berkshire\u2019s future.\n\u2039First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshireshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That\u2019s because our per-shareintrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.\nThis cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor\u2019s entry point into\nBerkshire stock is unusually high \u2013 at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shareshave occasionally reached \u2013 it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In otherwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshireis not exempt from this truth.\nPurchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company\nwould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire\u2019sdirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our\nview, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)\nFor those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer noassurances,\nwhatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods willlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic valueof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: \u201cIn the short-term the market is a votingmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.\u201d Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors \u2013amateurs and professionals alike \u2013 border on lunacy.\nSince I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire\nshares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years.",

These have proved to be quite profitable.Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that endedour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for someyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.\nMoreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.\nMany lifeinsurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a \u201crun\u201d in times of\nextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. Ifour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline \u2013 but only at a very slow pace.\nThe reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely\npredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen.

And if you can\u2019t predict what tomorrow will bring, youmust be prepared for whatever it does.\nA CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have\nonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be \u201cright\u201d 99% of the time. Those odds,however, hold no appeal for us.

    "be employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that thisproblem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire \u2013 likely as low as at any public company. In my\nservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I\u2019ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocreCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)\nIf elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all\ndirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about theCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors beapprehensive, Howard\u2019s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.\n\u2039Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire boardmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection andretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires thereplacement of a subsidiary\u2019s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire\u2019s CEO to be arational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights intohuman behavior. It\u2019s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, \u201cI\u2019m nogenius, but I\u2019m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.\u201d)\nCharacter is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be \u201call in\u201d for the company, not for himself. (I\u2019m using male\npronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can\u2019t helpbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it\u2019s important that neither ego nor avaricemotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements farexceed theirs.",

In certain important respects, this person will do a betterjob than I am doing.\n\u2039Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists.They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to becoordinated with Berkshire\u2019s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investmentmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. ToddCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire\u2019s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.\nAll told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right\npeople in place \u2013 the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks.

No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire wouldever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.\nBoth the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I\nknow of has half of such elements in place.\nHow did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire\u2019s shares and was completely trusted\nby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshiresystem.\nAlmost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire\u2019s\nachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire\u2019ssubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while usingdifferent systems.\nWhat was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:\n(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most\nimportant people in the system, starting with himself.\n(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually\nstayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.\n(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at\nheadquarters.\n(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.\nWhen Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into\nsome benefits through practice evolution.",
    "a basketball player does.\nMoreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,\nBuffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs andthe achievements of the subsidiaries.\nThen, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and\nBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries intoBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.\nAnd the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a\n\u201cvirtuous circle.\u201d\nHow well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?Marvelously well. Berkshire\u2019s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders\u2019 equity, as\ndid Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during thelast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.\nAnd, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries greatly\noutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire\u2019sstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurancebusiness that produced both a huge \u201cfloat\u201d and a large underwriting gain.

Ourequity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8%to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren\u2019t important, consider this math: For thefour companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire\u2019sportion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented.

In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortizationand minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax .\nI used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting\nincome in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire\u2019s two quantitative pillars ofvaluation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn\u2019tblow and the earth didn\u2019t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order tobe conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break evenover time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.\nToday, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we\nhave deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the secondparagraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and weanticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year couldwell be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our\nearnings ( including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip.",
    "r per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our\nearnings ( including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is no\ncoincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that ofour two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operatingearnings.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our\nintent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you beingthe reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don\u2019t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) branch of that industry has been the engine that\nhas propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, NationalFire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is farin excess of the value at which it is carried on our\nbooks.\n9\n\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensationaccidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit.",
    "his collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322015 87,722\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized\noperations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, is party toa number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will bevery gradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can\nnever be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This\nstructure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire\u2019s economic fortress. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss,\nin effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float.",
    "competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss,\nin effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insuranceindustry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest ratesthe world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many yearsto come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It\u2019s a good bet that industry results over the next tenyears will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize inreinsurance.\nAs noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive\nyears, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That\u2019s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation isthe daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned\nby poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testamentstyle.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of\nfloat as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses \u2013 a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 \u2013 and that reduces float.",
    "is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses \u2013 a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 \u2013 and that reduces float. Just assurely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.\n10\n\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying our\ninsurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on\nits true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, anygoodwill\nasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it \u2013 to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion we\ncarry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our\nfloat.",

    "intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearlydoes not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both,that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \u2013 even though, from an investor\u2019s viewpoint, theycould not differ more.\n15\n\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not. The \u201cnon-real\u201d charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.\nThe table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We now\nhave $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.Eventually, of course, every dollar of these \u201cassets\u201d will be charged off. When that happens, reported earningsincrease even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)\nI suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs.

Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their paymentbehavior during the Great Recession was farbetter than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people\nearning multiples of our typical borrower\u2019s income.\nThe strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we\u2019ve done well with our\nmortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short-term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us aconstantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, whichbears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds andfinanced the position in some short-term manner.)\n18\n\nNormally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at\nClayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn\nshort-term rates.

At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing andUrban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well.

We willexamine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.\nFor the moment, however, let\u2019s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences\nfor Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.\n\u2039In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved byClass I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.\nBy 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only\n187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-relatedemployees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggeringimprovement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars.\nAnother startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need\nwell over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employmentwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today\u2019s volume would actually move.)\n21\n\nOur own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe.",

In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced\n19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt-hours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a periodduring which industry rates increased 44%.\nThe safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015\ncompared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.\nIn 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our\npurchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year thenumbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours.

In safety, BHE nowranks in the industry\u2019s top decile.\nThose outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a\nutility in their jurisdiction.

The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might presentto our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.\nIt seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say \u201chighly likely\u201d\nrather than \u201ccertain\u201d because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most \u201cexperts\u201dabout Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage tothe world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting thedanger.\nThis issue bears a similarity to Pascal\u2019s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued\nthat if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because therewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy.",
    "lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy. Call this Noah\u2019s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival , begin building it today, no matter how\ncloudless the skies appear.\nIt\u2019s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by\nclimate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that propertylosses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- ortwenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repricedannually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.\n25\n\nThink back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company\u2019s average loss-per-policy\nwas then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increaseto about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn\u2019t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.\nOver the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans\ninvolved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable . If costs had\nremained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather thanone doing $23 billion.\nUp to now, climate change has notproduced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-\nrelated events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years,\nwhich is why we have backed away from that business.",

The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofThe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is asked.)\nAn accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\ninsurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Ourhope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge oftheir investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\u2019t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us.\nAll told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\n18 from the audience.

They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries(smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to workevery day. In fact, my job becomes more fun every year.\nIn 2015, Berkshire\u2019s revenues increased by $16 billion.

Actual earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of\nperiodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specific\nevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.\nIt\u2019s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your\ncapital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire rankedfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting manybillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.\nSome years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the\ncash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to beprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons.",
    "Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\nI earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment\nactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps \u2013making small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire\u2019s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketablesecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for$434 million in 1993. Dexter\u2019s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,giving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.\nThat wreck was followed by three key happenings \u2013 two positive, one negative \u2013 that set us firmly on\nour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn\u2019t already own, a cashtransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.GEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believeis now the world\u2019s premier property/casualty business.\nUnfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock \u2013 a boatload of\nstock \u2013 to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fineinsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares ofBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%.",

    "rease the normalized earnings of Berkshire will be aided \u2013 as they have been\nthroughout our managerial tenure \u2013 by America\u2019s economic dynamism. One word sums up our country\u2019sachievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago \u2013 a span of time less than triple my days onearth \u2013 Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitiousimmigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.\nYou need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you.\nSee the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productivefactories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it \u2013 they all represent a net gain forAmericans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, Americahas amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.\n5\n\nIt\u2019s true, of course, that American owners of homes, autos and other assets have often borrowed heavily\nto finance their purchases. If an owner defaults, however, his or her asset does not disappear or lose its\nusefulness. Rather, ownership customarily passes to an American lending institution that then disposes of it to anAmerican buyer. Our nation\u2019s wealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, \u201cMoney is always there, but the\npockets change.\u201d\nAbove all, it\u2019s our market system \u2013 an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor \u2013\nthat has created America\u2019s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards.Governmental redirection, through federal, state and local taxation, has in addition determined the distribution ofa significant portion of the bounty.\nAmerica has, for example, decided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the old\nand the young. Such forms of aid \u2013 sometimes enshrined as \u201centitlements\u201d \u2013 are generally thought of as applyingto the aged.",

Such forms of aid \u2013 sometimes enshrined as \u201centitlements\u201d \u2013 are generally thought of as applyingto the aged. But don\u2019t forget that four million American babies are born each year with an entitlement to a publiceducation. That societal commitment, largely financed at the local level, costs about $150,000 per baby. Theannual cost totals more than $600 billion, which is about 3\n1\u20442% of GDP.\nHowever our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almost\nexclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Thoseholdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet: Ourcitizens own assets abroad that are\nroughly comparable in value.\nEarly Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those people\nwho toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashedhuman potential, and their successors built upon it.\nThis economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, the\nbuild-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not ,however, be stopped. I\u2019ll\nrepeat what I\u2019ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are theluckiest crop in history.\n************\nAmerica\u2019s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20\nth\ncentury the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materiallyboosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced afurther 72%, to 19,763.\nAmerican business \u2013 and consequently a basket of stocks \u2013 is virtually certain to be worth far more in\nthe years ahead.",
    "One is when a business both needs all its available money toprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need forfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting itafter the needed expenditures are made.\nThe second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investment\nopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,Berkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely toarise.\nMy suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, join\nhands and in unison declare, \u201cWhat is smart at one price is stupid at another.\u201d\n************\nTo recap Berkshire\u2019s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at\n120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant andmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount toBerkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can\u2019t be precise.\nThe authorization given me does not mean that we will \u201cprop\u201d our stock\u2019s price at the 120% ratio. If\nthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creatingprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.\nTo date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear in\ndescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value issignificantly higher than 120% of book value.

Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell ina fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price \u2013 it\u2019s nofun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases \u2013 nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out\u201cpartners\u201d at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances couldcreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will beready to act.\n7\n\nOne final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people\nhave come close to calling them un-American \u2013 characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds\nneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn\u2019t the case: Both American corporations and private investorsare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I\u2019m not aware of anyenticing project that in recent\nyears has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s now look at Berkshire\u2019s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.\nThe property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades.",
    "s its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding largesums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float fortheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does ourfloat. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322016 91,577\nWe recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-time\nboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. NationalIndemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certainto drift downward.\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to\nimmediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is bydesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces.",
    "r be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, weenjoy the use of free money \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\n8\n\nThis outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout the\nworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies \u2013 though notthose of Berkshire \u2013 are heavily\nconcentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding a\npittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it\u2019s a good bet that industryresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case ofcompanies that specialize in reinsurance.\nNevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire\u2019s unrivaled financial strength allows us far\nmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to usare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, ourchoices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion.",
    "er, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. Thatrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know\nthat while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give thatmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount\nof our float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to\nthink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims and related expenses \u2013 a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 \u2013 and thatreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding tofloat.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go outthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, has nobearing on its true value.",
    "re. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged\nunderwriting losses, anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original\ncost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it \u2013 to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion\nwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.Yet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.This unrecorded asset is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value farexceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about themajor units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures\nrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposesBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, Berkshire is farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers.",

The second is enjoyed by fewother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed byany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of thecompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lowertheir cost of debt.

It would be foolish to focus over-intently on any single tree.\n************\nFor several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does not\nconform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rulesregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periodsaveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization \u201cexpenses\u201d are not truly an economic cost.Our goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way inwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.\nOn page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges to\nearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we showthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015.

(My gift to my successor.)\nNow that I\u2019ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less\npleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,which are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understate true\neconomic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, wheninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided \u2013 thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker \u2013 the inadequacy ofdepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time , in the railroad industry,\nwhere current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reportedearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.\n15\n\nAt BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion. But were\nwe to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive.\nThe reality is that \u2013 simply to hold our own \u2013 we need to spend far more than the cost we show for depreciation.\nMoreover, a wide disparity will prevail for decades.\nAll that said, Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our better purchases.\n************\nToo many managements \u2013 and the number seems to grow every year \u2013 are looking for any means to\nreport, and indeed feature , \u201cadjusted earnings\u201d that are higher than their company\u2019s GAAP earnings.

But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting \u201cadjustedper-share earnings\u201d makes us nervous. That\u2019s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look forways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be \u201chelpful\u201d as well. Goalslike that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed manyindustry participants.\nCharlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always \u201cmake the\nnumbers.\u201d In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur.When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make up the numbers.\nLet\u2019s get back to the two favorites of \u201cdon\u2019t-count-this\u201d managers, starting with \u201crestructuring.\u201d\nBerkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northerntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year atBerkshire. That\u2019s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, asI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.\nWe have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our\nnormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mentionit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinzmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations beexplained clearly to owners.",
    "ns suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these\nBerkshire managers is tantamount to \u201ccash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation\u201d and is therefore not a\u201ctrue\u201d expense. So \u2013 presto! \u2013 Berkshire, too, can have \u201cadjusted\u201d earnings.\nBack to reality: If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they should\nbe required to affirm to their owners one of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not a\ncost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings.\nDuring the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960s, the story was told of a CEO who, as\nhis company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, \u201cWhat is two plus two?\u201d The answer that wonthe assignment, of course, was, \u201cWhat number do you have in mind?\u201d\nFinance and Financial Products\nOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and\nMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader in\nits field.\nWe also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the sale\nof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earnings from its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton\nbecame America\u2019s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new Americanhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollar volume than Clayton because they sell site-built\nhomes that command much higher prices.)\nIn 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in\n2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton\u2019s unit sales in 2017and will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.\nEven so, Clayton\u2019s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new\nAmerican homes costing less than $150,000.",

Included in the $21 billion that the two\nmanage is about $7.6 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pensioninvestments are not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.\n************\nExcluded from the table \u2013 but important \u2013 is our ownership of $5 billion of preferred stock issued by\nBank of America. This stock, which pays us $300 million per year, also carries with it a valuable warrantallowing Berkshire to purchase 700 million common shares of Bank of America for $5 billion at any time beforeSeptember 2, 2021. At yearend, that privilege would have delivered us a profit of $10.5 billion. If it wishes,Berkshire can use its preferred shares to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrant.\n19\n\nIf the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock \u2013 now 30 cents annually \u2013 should rise above\n44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the\ncommon dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediatelybefore it expires.\nMany of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite\naggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most casesbeen underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows andoutstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.\n************\nIt\u2019s important for you to understand that 95% of the $86 billion of \u201ccash and equivalents\u201d (which in my\nmind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax.",
    "holders or media imply that we will own certain stocks \u201cforever.\u201d It is\ntrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we\u2019re talking20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold anyof its marketable securities forever.\nConfusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on\npages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled\nbusinesses , not marketable securities. This year I\u2019ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners\nunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.\n************\nBefore we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,\nlike most corporations, nets considerably more from a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capital\ngains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains asthe route to tax-favored returns.\nBut here\u2019s the corporate math. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it\n35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic\ncorporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.\n20\n\nFor a non-insurance company \u2013 which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent \u2013 the federal tax rate is\neffectively 101\u20442cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends.",
    "he federal tax rate is\neffectively 101\u20442cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to the\nsubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid itsown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applying\nto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualtycompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% ifthey own more than 20% of a U.S.-based investee.\nAnd that\u2019s our tax lesson for today.\n\u201cThe Bet\u201d (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)\nIn this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,\nnext, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, aunique establishment that played a role in the bet.\nLong Bets was seeded by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization that\nadministers just what you\u2019d guess: long-term bets. To participate, \u201cproposers\u201d post a proposition at Longbets.orgthat will be proved right or wrong at a distant date. They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the otherside of the bet.",
    "and I have needed to monitor the bet.\nFor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners\u2019 side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to be\naveraged and compared against my Vanguard S&P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money inmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not bedistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.\nEach fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedge\nfunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlyinghedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fundmanagers.\nHere are the results for the first nine years of the bet \u2013 figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,\nthe charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly openingthe mail next January.\nYear\nFund of\nFunds AFund of\nFunds BFund of\nFunds CFund of\nFunds DFund of\nFunds ES&PIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -2.9% 1.7% -1.4% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%Gain toDate 8.7% 28.3% 62.8% 2.9% 7.5% 85.4%\nFootnote: Under my agreement with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never\nbeen publicly disclosed. I, however, see their annual audits.\nThe compounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return that could easily\nprove typical for the stock market over time. That\u2019s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large \u201cshort\u201d positions.",
    "tant fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large \u201cshort\u201d positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stockswould have provided a tailwind for index funds.\nInstead we operated in what I would call a \u201cneutral\u201d environment. In it, the five funds-of-funds\ndelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested inthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000.\n22\n\nBear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a huge\nfinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected were\nsimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled toperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.\nI\u2019m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But\nthe results for their investors were dismal \u2013 really dismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the\nfunds and funds-of-funds involved \u2013 fees that were totally unwarranted by performance \u2013 were such that theirmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might haveput it: \u201cFees never sleep.\u201d\nThe underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners that\nlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of \u201c2 and 20,\u201d meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by badones).",
    "finition do about average. In aggregate their\npositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance ofthe universe\u2014the active investors\u2014must do about average as well. However, theseinvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costswill be worse than those of the passive investors.\nCosts skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs are\nall added to the active investor\u2019s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this costproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge fundsin which the funds of funds are invested.\nA number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their\nefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose oninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fundthan with a group of funds of funds.\n23\n\nSo that was my argument \u2013 and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)\nand Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve average\nresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requiresme to mention that there is a very minor point \u2013 not worth detailing \u2013 that slightly modifies this formulation.)\nAnd if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.\nThere are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over long\nstretches. In my lifetime, though, I\u2019ve identified \u2013 early on \u2013 only ten or so professionals that I expected would\naccomplish this feat.\nThere are no doubt many hundreds of people \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 whom I have never met and whose\nabilities would equal those of the people I\u2019ve identified.

    "are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million ,I\nwrote my limited partners: \u201cI feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to helpthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up toher to find some other partnership for them.\u201d\nThe bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will\nusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stickwith low-cost index funds.\n************\nIf a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-\ndown choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who havepromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing \u2013 or, as in our bet, lessthan nothing \u2013 of\nadded value.\nIn his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,\nhowever, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on theirsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\n************\nOver the years, I\u2019ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I\u2019ve\nlearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 indexfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\n24\n\nI believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed\nthat same advice when I\u2019ve given it to them.",
    "And, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.\nBerkshire loves to pay fees \u2013 even outrageous fees \u2013 to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions. Moreover,\nwe have paid substantial sums for over-performance to our two in-house investment managers \u2013 and we hope tomake even larger payments to them in the future.\nTo get biblical (Ephesians 3:18), I know the height and the depth and the length and the breadth of the\nenergy flowing from that simple four-letter word \u2013 fees \u2013 when it is spoken to Wall Street.

In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the result s are\ncalculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation\nsuch as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in yearswhen that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.",
    "investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be\nincluded in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capriciousswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of KraftHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.Including gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe ouroperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire\u2019s \u201cbottom-line\u201d will be useless.\nThe new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realized gains\n(or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,we have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they \u2013 just like our unrealized gains\u2013 fluctuate randomly.\nThat\u2019s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are trying\nto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period whenour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).\n*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof those\nshown for the A shares.\n3\n\nWith the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying to\nrealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of ournumbers.

    "nse of ournumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaperheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reportssometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.\nWe will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late on\nFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysisand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.Nevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.\nAt Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is what\nCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on \u2013 and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.\nAcquisitions\nThere are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-on\nacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our manyand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, wewill review 2017 acquisition activity.\nIn our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;\nable and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price .\nThat last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far\nfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high.",
    "s substantiallystrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\n\u0160 I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshire\nbacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in MidAmerican Energy (now named BerkshireHathaway Energy). MidAmerican\u2019s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid littleattention to HomeServices.\n5\n\nBut, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, HomeServices was the second-largest\nbrokerage operation in the country \u2013 still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,HomeServices\u2019 growth exploded. We acquired the industry\u2019s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12,Houlihan Lawrence; and Gloria Nilson.\nWith those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. HomeServices is now close to\nleading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of\u201csides\u201d during 2017. To explain that term, there are two \u201csides\u201d to every transaction; if we represent both buyer andseller, the dollar value of the transaction is counted twice.\nDespite its recent acquisitions, HomeServices is on track to do only about 3% of the country\u2019s home-\nbrokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this mostfundamental of businesses.\n\u0160 Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz GmbH, a\nGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components.

    "stparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz GmbH, a\nGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components. Please allow me to skip a furtherexplanation. I don\u2019t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, homebuilders or truck stops.\nFortunately, I don\u2019t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision,\nis an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on peoplecan sometimes be more certain than betting on physical assets.\nLet\u2019s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (\u201cp/c\u201d) insurance, a business I do\nunderstand and the engine that for 51 years has powered Berkshire\u2019s growth.\nInsurance\nBefore I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. We\nbegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With ourpurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able todeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned atBerkshire itself. In effect, we were \u201ctrading dollars\u201d for the net worth portion of the cost.\nThe $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usually\ndelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of \u201cfloat\u201d\u2013 money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.\nEver since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire.",
    "but was held by our two insurers.\nEver since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,are on our tab as well.)\nFloat materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfront\nwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, suchas car repairs, are quickly paid, others \u2013 such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos \u2013 may take many years tosurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, ofa person employed by one of our workers\u2019 compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafterrequiring expensive lifetime care.\n6\n\nFloat generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines of\nbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability \u2013 business labeled \u201clong-tail\u201d in industry jargon \u2013 thatgenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediatelymake payments to claimants for needed repairs.\nBerkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumbo\nreinsurance policies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of our\nemphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire\u2019s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country\u2019s secondlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.\nHere\u2019s the record:\n(in $ millions)\nYear\nPremium Volume Float\n1970 $ 39 $ 39\n1980 185 2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500\nOur 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\nAIG had incurred.",
    "2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500\nOur 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\nAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world\u2019s record and one we won\u2019t come close torepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.\nFloat will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it will\nbe modest \u2013 at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrenderoptions, p/c float can\u2019t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can\u2019t experience massive \u201cruns\u201d in times ofwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investmentdecisions.\nCharlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers \u2013 or even\nthat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked havingTreasury Bills \u2013 loads of Treasury Bills \u2013 that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines\nor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortablywithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures.\n************\nThe downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurance\ncan be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. Inthe 1980\u2019s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,threatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\nlong prioritized those qualities.",
    "oried operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\nlong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in suchinstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the\nearlier table.\nI have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light period\nthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significanthurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n7\n\nMy guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,\nhowever, could be faroff the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran\nlow. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-gradedexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer\u2019sfinancial condition for a very long time.\nWe currently estimate Berkshire\u2019s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion after\ntax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry losswas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in futureAmerican mega-cats.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worth\nby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worthranging from 7% to more than 15%.",
    "three hurricanes reduced Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worth\nby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worthranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been farworse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a\npath through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.\nWe believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insured\nlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increasesover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.\nNo company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share\nof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insuranceactivities. Concurrently, much \u2013 indeed, perhaps most \u2013 of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleledfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire \u2013 and only Berkshire \u2013 when they, themselves,\nneed to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.\nPrior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3\nbillion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,but also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax fromunderwriting.\nA large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K at\nthe back of this report.

You can read moreabout these businesses on pages K-5 \u2013 K-10 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-44.\nProceeding down Berkshire\u2019s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked by\nearnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol,Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4billion these companies earned in 2016.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1\nbillion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2016.\n8\n\nThe remaining businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 recorded little change in pre-tax\nincome, which was $3.7 billion in 2017 versus $3.5 billion in 2016.\nDepreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were\n$11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expendituresthat far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America\u2019seconomic soil remains fertile.\nAmortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a true\neconomic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciationcharges that fall well short of the sums regularly needed to keep the railroad in first-class shape.\nBerkshire\u2019s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we\nwill need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At yearend Berkshire held$116.0 billion in cash and U.S.",

Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered fourtruly major dips.

Even if your borrowings are small and yourpositions aren\u2019t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlinesand breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.\n10\n\nIn the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table. No one\ncan tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow.\nWhen major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped\nby debt. That\u2019s the time to heed these lines from Kipling\u2019s If:\n\u201cIf you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .If you can think \u2013 and not make thoughts your aim . .",

Now I have the final tally \u2013 and, inseveral respects, it\u2019s an eye-opener.\nI made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sum\nthat \u2013 if things turned out as I expected \u2013 would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) topublicize my conviction that my pick \u2013 a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund \u2013 would,over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded andincentivized those \u201chelpers\u201d may be.\nAddressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually to\nadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money\u2019sworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anything for their outlays?\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five \u201cfunds-of-funds\u201d that it expected to overperform\nthe S&P 500. That was nota small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedge\nfunds.\nEssentially, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund.",
    "t\u00e9g\u00e9, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. Thisassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.\nThe managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could \u2013 and did \u2013 rearrange\ntheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new \u201cstars\u201d while exiting their positions in hedgefunds whose managers had lost their touch.\nEvery actor on Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund\nmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally movesupwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500\nexceeded loss years.)\nThose performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich.",
    "Those performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur because\nfixed fees averaging a staggering 2\n1\u20442% of assets or so were paid every year by the fund-of-funds\u2019 investors, with part\nof these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of theunderlying hedge funds.\n11\n\nHere\u2019s the final scorecard for the bet:\nYearFund-of-\nFunds AFund-of-\nFunds BFund-of-\nFunds CFund-of-\nFunds DFund-of-\nFunds ES&P\nIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%\n2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -3.2% 1.9% -1.7% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%2017 12.2% 10.6% 15.6% N/A 18.0% 21.8%\nFinal Gain 21.7% 42.3% 87.7% 2.8% 27.0% 125.8%\nAverage\nAnnual Gain 2.0% 3.6% 6.5% 0.3% 2.4% 8.5%\nFootnote: Under my agreement with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never been publicly\ndisclosed.

    "uidated in 2017; itsaverage annual gain is calculated for the nine years of its operation.\nThe five funds-of-funds got off to a fast start, each beating the index fund in 2008. Then the roof fell in. In\nevery one of the nine years that followed, the funds-of-funds as a whole trailed the index fund.\nLet me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch.\nIf a poll of investment \u201cexperts\u201d had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, theirguesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in thatenvironment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street \u201chelpers\u201d earned staggering sums. While this groupprospered, however, many of their investors experienced a lost decade.\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.\n************\nThe bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, they\noccasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does notrequire great intelligence, a degree in\neconomics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is anability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to lookunimaginative for a sustained period \u2013 or even to look foolish \u2013 is also essential.\nOriginally, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000\nface amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called \u201cstrips\u201d). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 \u2013a bit less than 64\u00a2 on the dollar \u2013 with the $500,000 payable in ten years.\nAs the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were\npurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity.",
    ",000 payable in ten years.\nAs the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were\npurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I originally intended to do no more thantally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017.\n12\n\nAfter our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012,\nour bonds \u2013 now with about five years to go before they matured \u2013 were selling for 95.7% of their face value. At that\nprice, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88% .\nGiven that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb \u2013 a really dumb \u2013 investment compared to\nAmerican equities. Over time, the S&P 500 \u2013 which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriatelyweighted by market value \u2013 has earned farmore than 10% annually on shareholders\u2019 equity (net worth).\nIn November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cash return from dividends on the S&P 500 was 2\n1\u20442%\nannually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use theirretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,over time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And \u2013 as has been the case since 1776 \u2013 whatever its problems ofthe minute, the American economy was going to move forward.\nPresented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and\nI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire \u201cB\u201d shares.The result: Girls Inc.",
    "n 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.\nAfter that kindergarten-like analysis, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%\nwas certain to beat .88%.

Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Sincewhat we will be conducting is a shareholders\u2019 meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions\nthat add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\u2019t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came andfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.\nAll told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\n18 from the audience. After the 54\nth, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than\n60 by 3:30.\nThe questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m.\non the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room willhost, so to speak, a drawing.\nWhile I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, shouldalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That\u2019s why we try toissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (aday that also eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,\ntreating them instead as we do all other shareholders.",

Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smotheredin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch.

If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply\nto have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results woul d have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return,\nbut would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative r eturn. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to\nbe substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called\n\u201cGAAP\u201d).",
    "stantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called\n\u201cGAAP\u201d). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from animpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realizedcapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion lossfrom a reduction in the amount of unrealized\ncapital gains that existed in our investment holdings.\nA new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,\nneither Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us haveconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as \u201cwild andcapricious swings in our bottom line.\u201d\nThe accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth\nquarters, we reported GAAP losses of $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, we\nreported profits of $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses that\nBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in allquarters. For the year, those earnings\nexceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.\nWide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That\u2019s because our huge equity\nportfolio \u2013 valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 \u2013 will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line.",
    "alued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 \u2013 will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourthquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201closs\u201d of more than$4 billion.\nOur advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying\nthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them todeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing.\n************\nLong-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. For\nnearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire\u2019s per-share book value. It\u2019snow time to abandon that practice.\nThe fact is that the annual change in Berkshire\u2019s book value \u2013 which makes its farewell appearance on page\n2 \u2013 is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire hasgradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major valueresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, whileourequity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be\nincluded in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, itis likely that \u2013 over time \u2013 Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down.",
    "atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causesthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.\n3\n\nIn future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire\u2019s market price. Markets can be\nextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire\u2019s stock pricewill provide the best measure of business performance.\n************\nBefore moving on, I want to give you some good news \u2013 really good news \u2013 that is not reflected in our\nfinancial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in chargeof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.\nNow let\u2019s take a look at what you own.\nFocus on the Forest \u2013 Forget the Trees\nInvestors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses \u2013 our\neconomic \u201ctrees,\u201d so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array ofspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade fromnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.\nFortunately, it\u2019s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire\u2019s\nintrinsic business value. That\u2019s because our forest contains five \u201cgroves\u201d of major importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand.",
    "r importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth \u2013 our huge and diverse insurance operation \u2013 delivers great valueto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.\nBefore we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment\nof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part , that possess favorable and durable economic\ncharacteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.\nSometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes we\nseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach tohuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.\nIn recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for\nour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43billion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in whichwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.\nDespite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire\u2019s forest remains the\nmany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with lessthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year.",
    "d on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\nGAAP \u2013 which dictates the earnings we report \u2013 does not allow us to include the retained earnings of\ninvestees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retainedby our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than onedollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.\nAll of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings to\nrepurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee\u2019s stock is underpriced, we rejoicewhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire\u2019s ownership percentage.\n5\n\nHere\u2019s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire\u2019s holdings of American Express have remained\nunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because ofrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire\u2019s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and sharesoutstanding decrease, owners \u2013 over time \u2013 usually do well.\nA third category of Berkshire\u2019s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control with\nother parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses \u2013 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% ofBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J \u2013 totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.\nIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments.",
    "$1.3 billion in 2018.\nIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to beuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.We have also promised to avoid anyactivities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.\nBerkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of\ncommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, ourstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.\nIn the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will\npermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businessespossessing decent long-term prospects.\nThat disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable\nequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 \u2013 I\u2019m the\nyoung one \u2013 that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie\u2019s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a\nhuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)\nMy expectation of more stock purchases is nota market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will\nbehave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities.",
    "explain thecharacteristics of float later in this letter.\nFinally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire\u2019s value is maximized by our having assembled the\nfive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts ofcapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantageof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.\nAt Berkshire, the whole is greater \u2013 considerably greater \u2013 than the sum of the parts.\n6\n\nRepurchases and Reporting\nEarlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that we\nbuy at a discount to Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value \u2013 which certainly will be our intention \u2013 repurchases will benefit boththose shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.\nTrue, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That\u2019s because careful buying by\nus will minimize any impact on Berkshire\u2019s stock price. Nevertheless, there is some benefit to sellers in having an\nextra buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner\u2019s interest at,\nsay, 90\u00a2 on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase bythe company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.\nWhen a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it\u2019s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report.",
    "chases, it\u2019s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled orinadequately informed.\nSome sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments\nthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There areunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.\nIn addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it\u2019s time for them or their families to become net\nconsumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhapswe will become big spenders in our old age.\n************\nFor 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders\nwho are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have never focused on current-quarter results.\nBerkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports\nor balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and Ilearn of Berkshire\u2019s overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.\nFurthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Our\nlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly \u201cnumber\u201d to hit. Shunning the\nuse of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations.",
    "e culture we prize.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations.

Playing with the numbers \u201cjust thisonce\u201d may well be the CEO\u2019s intent; it\u2019s seldom the end result. And if it\u2019s okay for the boss to cheat a little, it\u2019s easyfor subordinates to rationalize similar behavior.\nAt Berkshire, our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for our\nshareholder-partners. The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.\n7\n\nNon-Insurance Operations \u2013 From Lollipops to Locomotives\nLet\u2019s now look further at Berkshire\u2019s most valuable grove \u2013 our collection of non-insurance businesses \u2013\nkeeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them.Additional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 \u2013 K-22 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-51.\nViewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over\n2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.\nI will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was\nfargreater \u2013 47 %\u2013 thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of\nthat year. Let\u2019s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\nBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \u201cowns\u201d an interest in Berkshire\u2019s\nearnings of a size determined by Congress.",
    "at year. Let\u2019s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\nBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \u201cowns\u201d an interest in Berkshire\u2019s\nearnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country\u2019s Treasury Department holds a special class of ourstock \u2013 call this holding the AA shares \u2013 that receives large \u201cdividends\u201d (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very wellwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury\u2019s \u201cstock,\u201d which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolvedinto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.\nLast year, however, 40% of the government\u2019s \u201cownership\u201d (14/35\nths) was returned to Berkshire \u2013 free of\ncharge \u2013 when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d shareholders received amajor boost in the earnings attributable to their shares.\nThis happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same\ndynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.\nThose are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the tax\nbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicableto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate haslong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,the new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerably more valuable.\nWhich suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses. Our two towering redwoods\nin this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before taxlast year, up 6% from 2017.",

Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before taxlast year, up 6% from 2017. You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 \u2013 K-10 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-45.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018of $6.4 billion, up from the $5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.4\nbillion pre-tax last year, up from $2.1 billion in 2017.\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 had pre-tax income of\n$3.6 billion in 2018 vs. $3.3 billion in 2017.\n8\n\nInsurance, \u201cFloat,\u201d and the Funding of Berkshire\nOur property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurance business \u2013 our fifth grove \u2013 has been the engine propelling\nBerkshire\u2019s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measuredby net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\u2019s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.",
    "ugh individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume.

And how it has grown, as the following\ntable shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)*\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,732\n* Includes float arising from life, annuity and health insurance businesses .\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns ontangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\nNevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire\u2019s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility\nin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are alwaysan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities.",
    "dated balance sheet \u2013 see page K-65 \u2013 resides at our railroad and\nenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businessesremains bountiful. The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and notguaranteed by Berkshire.\nOur level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire\u2019s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America. By\nretaining all earnings for a very long time, and allowing compound interest to work its magic, we have amassed fundsthat have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100%payout policy, we would still be working with the $22 million with which we began fiscal 1965.\nBeyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of\ncorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge netliability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That\u2019s because they\nhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paid in most years for holding and\nusing other people\u2019s money.\nAs I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in\nassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe thatwill dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur \u2013 perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \u201cThe\nBig One\u201d may come from a traditional source, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving,say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate.

    "n 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970s. At that time, GEICO, after a four-\ndecade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. Arecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO\u2019s loss costs and consequently underpriced itsproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO\u2019s books \u2013 there were no less than2.3 million of them \u2013 would expire and could then be repriced. The company\u2019s net worth in the meantime was rapidlyapproaching zero.\nIn 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concluded\nthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshirebought about\n1\u20443of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly1\u20442without our spending a dime. That stunning\naccretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this half-interest in GEICO cost Berkshire $47 million, about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.\nLet\u2019s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO\u2019s\nreputation and profitability had been restored \u2013 but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9million auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICOthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.\nLate in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the\ncompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!).",

Over time, however, investment performanceconverges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has beenextraordinary.\nThe American Tailwind\nOn March 11\nth, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was\n11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of CitiesService preferred stock.",
    "through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.\nNevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved\nto be well-founded. In fact, the nation\u2019s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.\nLet\u2019s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and all\ndividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (thelatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment\nby a tax-free institution of that time \u2013 say, a pension fund or college endowment \u2013 would have grown to about $5.3billion .\nLet me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid\nonly 1%of assets annually to various \u201chelpers,\u201d such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have\nbeen cut in half , to $2.65 billion. That\u2019s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved\nby the S&P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.\n13\n\nThose who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many\nyears) might note that our country\u2019s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.That\u2019s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and aworthless currency. To \u201cprotect\u201d yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 3\n1\u20444ounces of\ngold with your $114.75.\nAnd what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,\nless than 1% of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business.

The\nmagical metal was no match for the American mettle.\nOur country\u2019s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we have\nhad seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various timeswith a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of apresident, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems.

About that, we should rejoice:\nAmericans will be both more prosperous and safer if allnations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant\nsums across borders.\nOver the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by The\nAmerican Tailwind.

    "2/31.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire earned $81.4 billion in 2019 according to generally accepted accounting principles (commonly\ncalled \u201cGAAP\u201d). The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capitalgains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.\nThat $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requires\na company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealized gains and losses of those\nsecurities. As we stated in last year\u2019s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agreewith that rule.\nThe adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.\nBefore 2018, GAAP insisted \u2013 with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities \u2013 thatunrealized gains within a portfolio of stocks were never to be included in earnings and unrealized losses were to be\nincluded only if they were deemed \u201cother than temporary.\u201d Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter\u2019s bottom\nline \u2013 a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators \u2013 every up and down movement of the stocksit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.\nBerkshire\u2019s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a down\nyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreased by $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP\nearnings of only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7\nbillion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter.",
    "eply about how stocksshould be evaluated.\nFor the crux of Smith\u2019s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard\nKeynes: \u201cI have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith\u2019s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is\nan element of compound interest (Keynes\u2019 italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a period\nof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from thedividends paid out to the shareholders.\u201d\nAnd with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.It\u2019s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith\u2019s book was\npublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,Rockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produceever-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich followingthe same playbook.\nNevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces \u2013 \u201cstocks\u201d \u2013 buyers in the pre-Smith\nyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks wereconsidered speculations. Gentlemen preferred bonds.\nThough investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now well\nunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed \u201cnovel\u201d: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders.\n************\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously.",
    "4\n\nIn our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), the\nearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you. What you see is what youget.\nIn the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, only the dividends that Berkshire\nreceives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They\u2019re working hard and creatingmuch added value, but notin a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire\u2019s reported earnings.\nAt almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would notfind what we\u2019ll call this \u201cnon-\nrecognition of earnings\u201d important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for youbelow.\nHere, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earnings\nthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting \u2013 these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees\u2013 and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies useretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchasesignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire\u2019s share of the company\u2019s future earnings.\nYearend\nOwnership\nBerkshire\u2019s Share (in millions)\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 18.7% $ 261 $ 998\nApple 5.7% 773 2,519Bank of America 10.7% 682 2,167Bank of New York Mellon 9.0% 101 288Coca-Cola 9.3% 640 194Delta Airlines 11.0% 114 416J.P.

Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But bothlogic and our past experience indicate that from the group we will realize capital gains at least equal to \u2013 and probably\nbetter than \u2013 the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax onthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)\nIt is certain that Berkshire\u2019s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equity\nholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimescompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times \u2013 last year was one of those \u2013 our gainwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of major importance in the growth of\nBerkshire\u2019s value.\nMr. Smith got it right.\n5\n\nNon-Insurance Operations\nTom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gave\nme some important advice about acquisitions: \u201cTo achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy goodbusinesses.\u201d\nOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as \u201cgood\nbusinesses.\u201d Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters.",
    "\u201d\nOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as \u201cgood\nbusinesses.\u201d Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, onthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.\nIn reviewing my uneven record, I\u2019ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,\nwith a joyful wedding \u2013 but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, thenew union delivers bliss beyond either party\u2019s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those imagesto corporate acquisitions, I\u2019d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It\u2019s easy to getdreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.\nPursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy\nwith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,however, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.\nFortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by most\nbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the \u201cpoor\u201d business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in whichits operations require an ever-smaller percentage of Berkshire\u2019s capital. Meanwhile, our \u201cgood\u201d businesses often tend\nto grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrastingtrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire\u2019s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.\nAs an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire\u2019s original textile business. When\nwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire\u2019s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire\u2019s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns.",
    "company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire\u2019s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire\u2019s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,though, we acquired a spread of \u201cgood\u201d businesses, a shift that by the early 1980s caused the dwindling textileoperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.\nToday, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returns\non the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operationhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. Wewill save that discussion for the next section.\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after\ninterest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges \u2013 all of those pesky, but very real, coststhat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore.",

Additional information about these operations can befound on pages K-6 \u2013 K-21 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-52.\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) \u2013 the two lead dogs of Berkshire\u2019s non-\ninsurance group \u2013 earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%from 2018.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, NetJets, Shaw\nand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.\n6\n\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 had aggregate earnings\nof $2.7 billion in 2019, down from $2.8 billion in 2018.\nOur total net income in 2019 from the non-insurance businesses we control amounted to $17.7 billion, an\nincrease of 3% from the $17.2 billion this group earned in 2018. Acquisitions and dispositions had almost no net effecton these results.\n************\nI must add one final item that underscores the wide scope of Berkshire\u2019s operations. Since 2011, we have\nowned Lubrizol, an Ohio-based company that produces and markets oil additives throughout the world. On September26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.\nThe result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol\u2019s business.",
    "nsequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced \u2013 by maturities or issuer-call provisions \u2013\nto recycle their \u201cold\u201d investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurerscould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less iftheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).\nSome insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid\n\u201calternative\u201d investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutionsare ill-equipped to play.\nBerkshire\u2019s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled\nmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far moreinvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us arealways advantageous \u2013 and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.\nOur P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nAs I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years.",
    "I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.\nMistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years \u2013 even decades \u2013 to surface and\nripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur \u2013 perhaps\ntomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \u201cThe Big One\u201d may come from a traditional source, such as wind orearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anythinginsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and theywill be big \u2013 very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our\nresources, and we will be eager to addto our business the next day.\n** **********\nClose your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. New\nYork? London? Silicon Valley?\nHow about Wilkes-Barre?\n8\n\nLate in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he was\nbuying a tiny company \u2013 GUARD Insurance Group \u2013 in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its networth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD\u2019s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD andSy were new names to me.\nBingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and also\ndelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new productsand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD\u2019s float by 265%.\nIn 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20\nthyear under our ownership.",
    "an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20\nthyear under our ownership. That anniversary suggests\nthat we should be catching up with the company\u2019s accomplishments.\nWe\u2019ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing\n76% of BHE, the company\u2019s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).Prices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no baserate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here\u2019s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:Last year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE\u2019s. Recently, that utility received arate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.\nThe extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishments\nin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE\u2019s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hoursof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover theannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attainedwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.\nIn still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,\nwe know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of windself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customersare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE\u2019s ability to deliverrenewable, low-cost energy.\nOf course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time.",

Once,\ndebate about the responsibilities of boards was largely limited to lawyers; today, institutional investors and politicianshave weighed in as well.\nMy credentials for discussing corporate governance include the fact that, over the last 62 years, I have served\nas a director of 21 publicly-owned companies (listed below).

This year, it should be noted, marks the 100\nthanniversary of the 19thAmendment,\nwhich guaranteed American women the right to have their voices heard in a voting booth. Their attaining similar statusin a board room remains a work in progress.\nOver the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come into\nbeing.

This particular\ncompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.\nPaid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does notcreate wisdom or ensure business smarts.\nNevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shareswith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants.\n************\nHere, a pause is due: I\u2019d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been\ndecent, likable and intelligent.

Our thinking, boiled down:\nBerkshire will buy back its stock only if a) Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth and b) thecompany, upon completing the repurchase, is left with ample cash.\nCalculations of intrinsic value are far from precise. Consequently, neither of us feels any urgency to buy an\nestimated $1 of value for a very real 95 cents. In 2019, the Berkshire price/value equation was modestly favorable at\ntimes, and we spent $5 billion in repurchasing about 1% of the company.\nOver time, we want Berkshire\u2019s share count to go down .

We don\u2019t control the operations of those companies, but we do\nshare proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of theirearnings isnotincluded in Berkshire\u2019s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded on\nour books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible.\nWhat\u2019s out of sight, however, should notbe out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually\nbuilding value \u2013 lotsof value \u2013 for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make\nacquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout ourcountry\u2019s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions ofshareholders as well.\nOf course, some of our investees will disappoint, adding little, if anything, to the value of their company by\nretaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the hugepile of earnings retained by Berkshire\u2019s non-controlled businesses (what others would label our equity portfolio) toeventually deliver us an equal or greater amount of capital gains. Over our 56-year tenure, that expectation has beenmet.\n3\n\nThe final component in our GAAP figure \u2013 that ugly $11 billion write-down \u2013 is almost entirely the\nquantification of a mistake I made in 2016.

This\ngroup\u2019s startling durability \u2013 along with the fact that Charlie and I are 97 and 90, respectively \u2013 serves up an interestingquestion: Could it be that Berkshire ownership fosters longevity?\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of our\nreluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We already have the investors we want and don\u2019t\nthink that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements.\nThere are only so many seats \u2013 that is, shares outstanding \u2013 available for Berkshire ownership. And we very\nmuch like the people already occupying them.\nOf course, some turnover in \u201cpartners\u201d will occur. Charlie and I hope, however, that it will be minimal. Who,\nafter all, seeks rapid turnover in friends, neighbors or marriage?\nIn 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company to\nmanaging a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either\nhamburgers served with a Coke ora French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines. But you must not, Fisher warned,\ncapriciously switch from one to the other: Your message to potential customers must be consistent with what they willfind upon entering your premises.\nAt Berkshire, we have been serving hamburgers and Coke for 56 years. We cherish the clientele this fare has\nattracted.\nThe tens of millions of other investors and speculators in the United States and elsewhere have a wide variety\nof equity choices to fit their tastes.

Most\nowners of such properties will be rewarded. All that\u2019s required is the passage of time, an inner calm, amplediversification and a minimization of transactions and fees. Still, investors must never forget that their expenses are\nWall Street\u2019s income .

After decades of management, Charlie and I remain unable to promiseresults. We cananddo, however, pledge to treat you as partners.\nAnd so, too, will our successors.\nA Berkshire Number that May Surprise You\nRecently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based\nproperty, plant and equipment \u2013 the sort of assets that make up the \u201cbusiness infrastructure\u201d of our country \u2013 with aGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by anyother U.S. company.

    "d a few decades ago asmature and rationalized.\nBNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedents\nwhose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company\u2019s extensive lineage is laid out athttp://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf.\nBerkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixed\nassets, an outlay $20 billion in excess of its depreciation charges. Railroading is an outdoor sport, featuring mile-longtrains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrainfrom deserts to mountains. Massive flooding periodically occurs. BNSF owns 23,000 miles of track, spread throughout28 states, and must spend whatever it takes to maximize safety and service throughout its vast system.\n13\n\nNevertheless, BNSF has paid substantial dividends to Berkshire \u2013 $41.8 billion in total. The railroad pays us,\nhowever, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about$2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt byBerkshire.\nOne further word about BNSF: Last year, Carl Ice, its CEO, and his number two, Katie Farmer, did an\nextraordinary job in controlling expenses while navigating a significant downturn in business. Despite a 7% declinein the volume of goods carried, the two actually increased BNSF\u2019s profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Carl, aslong planned, retired at yearend and Katie took over as CEO. Your railroad is in good hands.\nBHE, unlike BNSF, pays nodividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utility\nindustry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country\u2019selectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering.",

We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and\nthrough the annual meeting as well.\nOur policy is to treat all shareholders equally.

    "to be.\nWhat You Own\nBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group\nlargely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.\nWhatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable\neconomic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nI make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that\nhave truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that \u2013 on occasion \u2013 it becomes easy to buy pieces of\nwonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated\ntransactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the\nmarketable arena.\n3\n\nSurprise, Surprise\nHere are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:\n\u2022 Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,\nBerkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based \u201cinfrastructure\u201d assets \u2013 classified on our balance sheet as\nproperty, plant and equipment \u2013 than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That\nsupremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.\nAt yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire\u2019s balance sheet at $158 billion.\nThat number increased last year and will continue to increase.",
    "1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire\u2019s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.\nDuring the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire\u2019s troubles. All told, the\ncompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period \u2013 a pathetic $100 per day .\nEarly in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and\nsteered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the\nyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.\nBerkshire\u2019s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their \u201csilent\npartner,\u201d the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income\ntax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.\n4\n\nIn fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge \u2013 indeed trumpet \u2013 the fact\nthat Berkshire\u2019s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our\ncountry would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,\nhowever, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.\n\u2022 From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in\ninsurance \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us.",
    "ag, saythanks.\n\u2022 From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in\ninsurance \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small\nsum derived from life insurance, Berkshire\u2019s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the\ninsurance business to $147 billion .\nSo far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance\nlosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year\nprofit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.\nOf equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,\nbut their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.\nIf you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To\nmy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (\u201cgenerally-accepted accounting principles\u201d) presentation of earnings\nand net worth.\nMuch of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire\u2019s good luck in my 1986 hiring of\nAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, \u201cNone.\u201d\nI said, \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect,\u201d and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as\ncould have been made. Better yet, he continues to be \u2013 35 years later.\nOne final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely \u2013 but farfrom assured \u2013 that Berkshire\u2019s float\ncan be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss.",
    "p from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple\u2019s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds\nto gain our accretion. Apple\u2019s repurchases did the job.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire\nreports \u2013 and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our \u201cshare\u201d of Apple\u2019s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act\nwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim\u2019s managerial touch as well.\n\u2022 BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an\nindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire.

    "and BHE) will always\nhold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and never\ndependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants and you to do so as well.\nBut $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lost\nour overwhelming preference for business ownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago,\non March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequired allof my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:\nNever bet against America.)\nAfter my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favored status throughout\nthat period was 100% \u2013 and still is. Berkshire\u2019s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.\nCharlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods are\nnever pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.\nShare Repurchases\nThere are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and center\nin our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire\u2019s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire\u2019s resources.\nOur second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are\npublicly traded.",
    "ther companies, and it would be value -destroying if we were to overpay\nwhen we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.\nIt should be noted that Berkshire\u2019s buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base.\nIf our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.\nFinally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we\u2019ve discussed, insurance \u201cfloat\u201d\nof the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of \u201cfloat\u201d per\nshare . That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% \u2013 going from $79,387 per \u201cA\u201d share to $99,497, a\nmeaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.\nA Wonderful Man and a Wonderful Business\nLast year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary of\nBerkshire. Throughout his life \u2013 in both his business and his personal pursuits \u2013 Paul quietly displayed all the qualities\nthat Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.\nIn 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing a\nhuge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.\nWith his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics\n(later renamed TTI).

But he\nhad one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend\u2019s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man\u2019s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending on him if he should unexpectedly die?\nFor a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, that\ncourse made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative \u201csynergies\u201d \u2013 savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.\nB u t...S u c hap u r c h aser would most certainly also retain itsCFO, itslegal counsel, itsHR unit. Their TTI\ncounterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer\u2019shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.\n9\n\nWhatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He next\nconsidered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled \u2013 aptly so \u2013 a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an \u201cexit strategy.\u201d And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.\nWhen Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers.",
    "oodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.\nWhen Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summed\nup his dilemma by saying \u2013 in far more tactful phrasing than this \u2013 \u201cAfter a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.\u201d So, I made an offer and Paul said \u201cYes.\u201d One meeting; onelunch; one deal.\nTo say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the company\nemployed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.\nAnnually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tell\nme, \u201cWe can talk about that next year, Warren; I\u2019m too busy now.\u201d\nWhen Greg Abel and I attended Paul\u2019s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-time\nassociates (including TTI\u2019s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.\nAt the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silently\nsupported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary \u2013 geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.\nIn all ways, Paul was a class act.\n************\nGood luck \u2013 occasionally extraordinary luck \u2013 has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed\na mutual friend \u2013 John Roach \u2013 TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.\nEvery fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives.",

Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year with\nstudents of all ages, finally \u201cretiring\u201d from that pursuit in 2018.\nAlong the way, my toughest audience was my grandson\u2019s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirming\nin their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that \u201csecrets\u201d are catnip to kids.\nTeaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon\nthe orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.\nTalking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)\nwith the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may\ninterfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be \u201cworking.\u201d\nCharlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-\ntimers at my grandfather\u2019s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.\nFinally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now \u201cworked\u201d for\nmany decades with people whom we like and trust.

    "hareholders like ours?\nWhat We Do\nCharlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership.\nFirst, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directscapital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operatingdecisions. When large enterprises are being managed, both trust and rules are essential. Berkshireemphasizes the former to an unusual \u2013 some would say extreme \u2013 degree. Disappointments areinevitable. We are understanding about business mistakes; our tolerance for personal misconduct\nis zero.\nIn our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we\npassively own pieces of businesses. Holding these investments, we have no say in management.\n3\n\nOur goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with\nboth long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please noteparticularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-termbusiness performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nOver the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of\nbusinesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, manythat enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way,other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public.Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrentlydelivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon \u201ccreativedestruction.\u201d\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that \u2013 episodically \u2013 it becomes easy to\nbuy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices.",
    "humpeter called this phenomenon \u201ccreativedestruction.\u201d\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that \u2013 episodically \u2013 it becomes easy to\nbuy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It\u2019s crucial to understand that stocks often\ntrade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. \u201cEfficient\u201d markets exist only in textbooks. Intruth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only inretrospect.\nControlled businesses are a different breed. They sometimes command ridiculously higher\nprices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations. Unless under duress, theowner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation.\n************\nAt this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management,\nmost of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, badmoves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes fromnear-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.)\nOur satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions \u2013 that\nwould be about one every five years \u2013 anda sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term\ninvestors such as Berkshire. Let\u2019s take a peek behind the curtain.\nThe Secret Sauce\nIn August 1994 \u2013 yes, 1994 \u2013 Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400\nmillion shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion \u2013 then a very meaningfuls u ma tB e r k s h i r e .\nThe cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend\nhad increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie\nand I were required to do was cash Coke\u2019s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checksa r eh i g h l yl i k e l yt og r o w .\n4\n\nAmerican Express is much the same story.",
    "thdays. All Charlie\nand I were required to do was cash Coke\u2019s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checksa r eh i g h l yl i k e l yt og r o w .\n4\n\nAmerican Express is much the same story. Berkshire\u2019s purchases of Amex were essentially\ncompleted in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from thisinvestment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely\nto increase.\nThese dividend gains, though pleasing, are farfrom spectacular. But they bring with them\nimportant gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion whileAmex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire\u2019s networth, akin to its weighting long ago.\nAssume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one\nthat flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be ahigh-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant0.3% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so ofannual income.\nThe lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom.\nOver time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and liveinto your 90s as well.\nThe Past Year in Brief\nBerkshire had a good year in 2022. The company\u2019s operating earnings \u2013 our term for\nincome calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), exclusive of\ncapital gains or losses from equity holdings \u2013 set a record at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus onthis operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment ,\nfluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date.",
    "ord at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus onthis operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment ,\nfluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date. Note its acrobatic behavior in 2022,which is in no way unusual:\nEarnings in $ billions\n2022 Quarter \u201cOperating Earnings\u201dGAAP Earnings We\nare Required to Report\n1 7.0 5.5\n2 9.3 (43.8)3 7.8 (2.7)4 6.7 18.2\nThe GAAP earnings are 100% misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually. Capital\ngains, to be sure, have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades, and we expect themto be meaningfully positive in future decades. But their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly andmindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.\n5\n\nA second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany\nCorporation, a property-casualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon. I\u2019ve worked with Joe in thepast, and he understands both Berkshire and insurance. Alleghany delivers special value tous because Berkshire\u2019s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to followvaluable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors.\nAided by Alleghany, our insurance float increased during 2022 from $147 billion to $164\nbillion. With disciplined underwriting, these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over\ntime. Since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in 1967, Berkshire\u2019s float has increased8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations. Though notrecognized in our\nfinancial statements, this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire. New shareholderscan get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float onpage A-2.\n************\nAvery minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share\nrepurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investeesof ours.",
    "*******\nAvery minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share\nrepurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investeesof ours. At Berkshire, we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses byrepurchasing 1.2% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. At Apple and Amex, repurchasesincreased Berkshire\u2019s ownership a bit without any cost to us.\nThe math isn\u2019t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many\nbusinesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just\nas surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such\ntimes, gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly, but expensive, investment\nbanker who recommended the foolish purchases.\nGains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit allowners \u2013 in\nevery respect. Imagine, if you will, three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership,\none of whom manages the business. Imagine, further, that one of the passive owners wishes to sellhis interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders. Whencompleted, has this transaction harmed anyone? Is the manager somehow favored over thecontinuing passive owners? Has the public been hurt?\nWhen you are told that allrepurchases are harmful to shareholders orto the country, or\nparticularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or asilver-tongued demagogue (characters that are notmutually exclusive).\n6\n\nAlmost endless details of Berkshire\u2019s 2022 operations are laid out on pages K-33 \u2013 K-66.\nCharlie and I, along with many Berkshire shareholders, enjoy poring over the many facts andfigures laid out in that section.

Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticatedby CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well.Beating \u201cexpectations\u201d is heralded as a managerial triumph.\nThat activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire\nto deceive is required. \u201cBold imaginative accounting,\u201d as a CEO once described his deception tome, has become one of the shames of capitalism.\n58 Years \u2013 and a Few Figures\nIn 1965, Berkshire was a one-trick pony, the owner of a venerable \u2013 but doomed \u2013 New\nEngland textile operation. With that business on a death march, Berkshire needed an immediatefresh start. Looking back, I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems.\nAnd then came a stroke of good luck: National Indemnity became available in 1967, and\nwe shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations.\nThus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous\nsavings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, ouravoidance of major mistakes and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 the American Tailwind. America would\nhave done fine without Berkshire.",
    "s (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, ouravoidance of major mistakes and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 the American Tailwind. America would\nhave done fine without Berkshire. The reverse is nottrue.\nBerkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified\nbusinesses. Let\u2019s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily onNASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&P500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies.\nIn aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don\u2019t yet have the final results for 2022.\nUsing, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billionor more. Indeed, 23 lost money.\n7\n\nAt yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American\nExpress, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody\u2019s, Occidental Petroleum andParamount Global.\nIn addition to those eight investees, Berkshire owns 100% of BNSF and 92% of BH\nEnergy, each with earnings that exceed the $3 billion mark noted above ($5.9 billion at BNSF and$4.3 billion at BHE). Were these companies publicly-owned, they would replace two presentmembers of the 500. All told, our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshiremore broadly aligned with the country\u2019s economic future than is the case at any other U.S.company. (This calculation leaves aside \u201cfiduciary\u201d operations such as pension funds andinvestment companies.) In addition, Berkshire\u2019s insurance operation, though conducted throughmany individually-managed subsidiaries, has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE.\nAs for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills\nalong with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any\nuncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedentedinsurance losses.",
    "ong with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any\nuncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedentedinsurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer \u2013 a task it is irresponsible todelegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshireshares, bought with their own money. Andyes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper\nby retaining earnings.\nAt Berkshire, there will be no finish line.\nSome Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes\nDuring the decade ending in 2021, the United States Treasury received about $32.3 trillion\nin taxes while it spent $43.9 trillion.\nThough economists, politicians and many of the public have opinions about the\nconsequences of that huge imbalance, Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe thatnear-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless. Our job is to manage Berkshire\u2019soperations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that willpreserve the company\u2019s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwiderecessions occur. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but thisattribute is farfrom perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.\nThe $32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes\n(48%), social security and related receipts (34\n1\u20442%), corporate income tax payments (81\u20442%) and a\nwide variety of lesser levies. Berkshire\u2019s contribution via the corporate income tax was $32 billionduring the decade, almost exactly a tenth of 1% of allmoney that the Treasury collected.\n8\n\nAnd that means \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S.\nmatching Berkshire\u2019s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country\u2019s 131 millionhouseholds would have needed to pay anytaxes to the federal government.",

Let me introduce her.\nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never,\nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship.

It is filled with a vast amount of information \u2013 some important, some trivial.\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\nK-72.

Accordingly, Berkshire also reports to Bertie and you what we call\n\u201coperating earnings.\u201d Here is the story they tell: $27.6 billion for 2021; $30.9 billion for 2022 and\n$37.4 billion for 2023.\n4\n\nThe primary  difference between the mandated figures and the ones Berkshire prefers is that\nwe exclude unrealized capital gains or losses that at times can exceed $5 billion a day .

But, at Berkshire, we can be stubborn.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMake no mistake about the significance of capital gains: I expect them to be a very\nimportant component of Berkshire\u2019s value accretion during the decades ahead. Why else would we commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie\u2019s) to marketable equities just as I have been doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime?\nI can\u2019t remember a period since March 11, 1942 \u2013 the date of my first stock purchase \u2013 that\nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based  equities. And so far, so good.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I \u201cpulled the trigger.\u201d I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that index hovers around 38,000. America has been a terrific country for investors.

As Ben Graham taught me, \u201cIn the short run the market acts as a voting machine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.\u201d\nWhat We Do\nOur goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that\nenjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. Within capitalism, some businesses will flourish for a very long time while others will prove to be sinkholes. It\u2019s harder than you would think to predict which will be the winners and losers. And those who tell you they know the answer are usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen.\nAt Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional  capital at\nhigh returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies \u2013 and simply sitting tight \u2013 can deliver wealth almost beyond measure. Even heirs to such a holding can \u2013 ugh! \u2013 sometimes live a lifetime of leisure.\nWe also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though\nthat is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share of disappointments.\n5\n\nIn 1863, Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all\nnational banks. His instructions included this warning: \u201cNever deal with a rascal under the expectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.\u201d Many bankers who thought they could \u201cmanage\u201d the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch\u2019s advice \u2013 and I have as well. People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true now as it was in 1863.\nThis combination of the two necessities I\u2019ve described for acquiring businesses has for\nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate.",
    "t was in 1863.\nThis combination of the two necessities I\u2019ve described for acquiring businesses has for\nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate. If I missed one \u2013 and I missed plenty \u2013 another always came along.\nThose days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases\nwas also a factor.\nBerkshire now has \u2013 by far  \u2013 the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American\nbusiness. Record operating income and a strong stock market led to a yearend figure of $561 billion. The total GAAP net worth for the other 499 S&P companies \u2013 a who\u2019s who of American\nbusiness \u2013 was $8.9 trillion in 2022. (The 2023 number for the S&P has not yet been tallied but is unlikely to materially exceed $9.5 trillion.)\nBy this measure, Berkshire now occupies nearly 6% of the universe in which it operates.\nDoubling our huge base is simply not possible within, say, a five-year period, particularly because we are highly averse to issuing shares (an act that immediately juices net worth).\nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the\nneedle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can\u2019t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful  options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All\nin all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\nNevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive\nside, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies. By both luck and pluck, a few huge winners have emerged from a great many dozens of decisions.",

Anything beyond \u201cslightly better,\u201d though, is wishful thinking.

Indeed, markets can \u2013 and will \u2013 unpredictably seize up or even vanish  as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days\nin 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008.

Though the stock\nmarket is massively larger than it was in our early years, today\u2019s active  participants are neither\nmore emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\nOne fact of financial life should never be forgotten. Wall Street \u2013 to use the term in its\nfigurative sense \u2013 would like its customers to make money, but what truly causes its denizens\u2019\njuices to flow is feverish activity. At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be\nvigorously marketed \u2013 not by everyone but always by someone.\nOccasionally, the scene turns ugly. The politicians then become enraged; the most flagrant\nperpetrators of misdeeds slip away, rich and unpunished; and your friend next door becomes bewildered, poorer and sometimes vengeful.

Berkshire\u2019s strength comes from its Niagara of diverse earnings\ndelivered after  interest costs, taxes and substantial charges for depreciation and amortization\n(\u201cEBITDA\u201d is a banned measurement at Berkshire). We also operate with minimal requirements for cash, even if the country encounters a prolonged period of global economic weakness, fear and near-paralysis.\nBerkshire does not currently pay dividends, and its share repurchases are 100%\ndiscretionary. Annual debt maturities are never material.\nYour company also holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill  position far in excess of what\nconventional wisdom deems necessary. During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated  cash from\noperations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared  for one.\nExtreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in\nownership of Berkshire.

Each only accounts for 4-5% of Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worth. But they are meaningful assets and also illustrate our thought processes.\nAmerican Express began operations in 1850, and Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta\ndrug store in 1886. (Berkshire is not big on newcomers.) Both companies tried expanding into\nunrelated areas over the years and both found little success in these attempts. In the past \u2013 but definitely  not now \u2013 both were even mismanaged.\nBut each was hugely successful in its base business, reshaped here and there as conditions\ncalled for. And, crucially, their products \u201ctraveled.\u201d Both Coke and AMEX became recognizable names worldwide as did their core products, and the consumption of liquids and the need for\nunquestioned financial trust are timeless essentials of our world.\n8\n\nDuring 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke \u2013 extending our own\nRip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings  in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase.\nBoth AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 \u2013 about 16%\nin the case of AMEX \u2013 and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the\nyear. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell\nyou: \u201cNo way.\u201d\nThough Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect\nownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every  asset that Berkshire\nowns.

Patience  pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that\nare inevitable.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThis year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain\nindefinitely. Like Coke and AMEX, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources. They are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023.\nAt yearend, Berkshire owned 27.8% of Occidental Petroleum\u2019s common shares and also\nowned warrants that, for more than five years, give us the option  to materially increase our\nownership at a fixed price. Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option, Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental. We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very much in our country\u2019s interest.\nNot so long ago, the U.S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had\nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U.S. production was eight million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (\u201cBOEPD\u201d), a level far short of the country\u2019s needs. From the favorable energy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to become heavily dependent on foreign \u2013 potentially unstable \u2013 suppliers.",
    "needs. From the favorable energy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to become heavily dependent on foreign \u2013 potentially unstable \u2013 suppliers. Further declines in oil production were predicted along with future increases in usage.\n9\n\nFor a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five\nmillion BOEPD by 2007. Meanwhile, the U.S. government created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (\u201cSPR\u201d) in 1975 to alleviate \u2013 though not come close to eliminating \u2013 this erosion of American self-sufficiency.\nAnd then \u2013 Hallelujah! \u2013 shale economics became feasible in 2011, and our energy\ndependency ended. Now, U.S. production is more than 13 million BOEPD, and OPEC no longer has the upper hand. Occidental itself has annual U.S. oil production that each year comes close to matching the entire inventory of the SPR. Our country would be very \u2013 very \u2013 nervous today if\ndomestic production had remained at five million BOEPD, and it found itself hugely dependent on non-U.S. sources. At that level, the SPR would have been emptied within months if foreign oil became unavailable.\nUnder Vicki Hollub\u2019s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country\nand its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But\nVicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that\u2019s an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAdditionally, Berkshire continues to hold its passive and long-term interest in five very\nlarge Japanese companies, each of which operates in a highly-diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel and I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five.",
    "ay Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel and I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies\ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U.S.) Berkshire has also pledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%. Our cost for the five totals \u00a51.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was \u00a52.9 trillion. However, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was 61% or $8 billion.\nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don\u2019t\nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese position with the proceeds from \u00a51.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in Japan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other American company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion, a sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the 2020-23 period.\nIn certain important ways, all five companies \u2013 Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and\nSumitomo \u2013 follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each  of the five has reduced the\nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices .\n10\n\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about\ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States.

The large sums the five retain are used both to\nbuild their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue  shares.\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to\nopportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs have the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be instantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\nOur Japanese purchases began on July 4, 2019. Given Berkshire\u2019s present size, building\npositions through open-market purchases takes a lot of patience and an extended period of \u201cfriendly\u201d prices. The process is like turning a battleship.

    "4,549\nOperating earnings .......................... $37,350 $30,853\nAt Berkshire\u2019s annual gathering on May 6, 2023, I presented the first quarter\u2019s results\nwhich had been released early that morning. I followed with a short summary of the outlook for the full year: (1) most of our non-insurance  businesses faced lower earnings in 2023; (2) that\ndecline would be cushioned by decent results at our two largest non-insurance businesses, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) which, combined, had accounted for more than 30% of operating earnings in 2022; (3) our investment income was certain  to materially grow because the\nhuge U.S. Treasury bill position held by Berkshire had finally begun to pay us far more than the pittance we had been receiving and (4) insurance would likely do well, both because its underwriting earnings are not correlated to earnings elsewhere in the economy and, beyond that, property-casualty insurance prices had strengthened.\n11\n\nInsurance came through as expected. I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\nand BHE. Let\u2019s take a look at each.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRail is essential to America\u2019s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\nway \u2013 measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity \u2013 of moving heavy materials to distant destinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must  travel to\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can\u2019t run without rail, and the industry\u2019s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American businesses, railroads eat capital.\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted other fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet.",
    "ems that blanket North America. Our railroad\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted other fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least $500 billion to replicate those assets and decades  to complete the job.\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain  its present\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested, but it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess  of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1\n1\u20442 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall  considerably short of\nBNSF\u2019s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad\u2019s debt. And that we do not intend to do.\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That\u2019s no surprise to me or Berkshire\u2019s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a small fraction of its replacement value.\nNorth America\u2019s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\nexported goods, etc. one-way  for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization of track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise.",
    "e problem for\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization of track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I sit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees working under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must deal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or mentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car, extraordinarily heavy train that can\u2019t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more common in Europe and will always be with us.\n12\n\nWage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required  to carry many dangerous products every\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words \u201ccommon carrier\u201d define railroad responsibilities.\nLast year BNSF\u2019s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country\u2019s inflation goals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five since our purchase.",
    "h BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five since our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our margin comparisons can and should improve.\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF\u2019s contribution to the country and the people who\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America\u2019s commercial arteries open. Railroads don\u2019t get much attention when they are working but, were they unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as expected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or even bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California\u2019s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii). In such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once regarded as among the most stable industries in America.\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior performance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely be required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that utilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE\u2019s extensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some years from completion.",
    "company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive negative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is risk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we will not knowingly  throw good money after bad.\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to adopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many public-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will decide which model they prefer.\nWhen the dust settles, America\u2019s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire\u2019s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (\u201cP/C\u201d) provides the core of Berkshire\u2019s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years and despite our nearly 5,000-fold  increase in volume \u2013 from $17 million to $83  billion  \u2013 we have\nmuch room to grow.\nBeyond that, we have learned \u2013 too often, painfully \u2013 a good deal about what types of\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid . The most important lesson is that our\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can\u2019t be\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\nSurprises  in the P/C business \u2013 which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\npolicies have expired \u2013 are almost always negative. The industry\u2019s accounting is designed to recognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge.",
    "can occur decades after six-month or one-year\npolicies have expired \u2013 are almost always negative. The industry\u2019s accounting is designed to recognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved, detection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates of future loss payments but inflation \u2013 both monetary and the \u201clegal\u201d variety \u2013 is a wild card.\n14\n\nI\u2019ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\nnewcomers to page 18. Here, I will only repeat that our position would not be what it is if Ajit Jain had not joined Berkshire in 1986. Before that lucky day \u2013 aside from an almost unbelievably wonderful experience with GEICO that began early in 1951 and will never end \u2013 I was largely wandering in the wilderness, as I struggled to build our insurance operation.\nAjit\u2019s achievements since joining Berkshire have been supported by a large cast of\nhugely-talented insurance executives in our various P/C operations. Their names and faces are unknown to most of the press and the public. Berkshire\u2019s lineup of managers, however, is to P/C insurance what Cooperstown\u2019s honorees are to baseball.\nBertie, you can feel good about the fact that you own a piece of an incredible P/C operation\nthat now operates worldwide with unmatched financial resources, reputation and talent. It carried the day in 2023.\nWhat is it with Omaha?\nCome to Berkshire\u2019s annual gathering on May 4, 2024. On stage you will see the three\nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may wonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don\u2019t look alike. Let\u2019s dig deeper.\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire \u2013 and in all respects is\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow \u2013 was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey). In the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me.",
    "rhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged as one of the country\u2019s great investors.\nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it.\nBut that\u2019s not true. After starting a family in 1956, Bertie was active financially for 20 years: holding bonds, putting\n1\u20443 of her funds in a publicly-held mutual fund and trading stocks with some\nfrequency. Her potential remained unnoticed.\nThen, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided\nto make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during\nthe next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic gifts (think nine figures).\nMillions of American investors could  have followed her reasoning which involved only\nthe common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha. And, taking no chances, Bertie returns to Omaha every  May to be re-energized.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSo what is going on? Is it Omaha\u2019s water? Is it Omaha\u2019s air? Is it some strange planetary\nphenomenon akin to that which has produced Jamaica\u2019s sprinters, Kenya\u2019s marathon runners, or Russia\u2019s chess experts? Must we wait until AI someday yields the answer to this puzzle?\nKeep an open mind. Come to Omaha in May, inhale the air, drink the water and say \u201chi\u201d\nto Bertie and her good-looking daughters. Who knows? There is no downside, and, in any event, you will have a good time and meet a huge crowd of friendly people.\nTo top things off, we will have available the new 4\nth edition of Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack.\nPick up a copy.
