In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return.

It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201dearning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our sharecount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash.", "g this railroad will increase Berkshire\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201dearning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our sharecount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we\u2019ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of thistransaction have turned out very well.\nA \u201cnormal year,\u201d of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire\nand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earningpower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general businessclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, andseveral others that I will explain in the \u201cInvestment\u201d section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of theassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains orlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base.\nBoth of us are enthusiastic about BNSF\u2019s future because railroads have major cost and environmental\nadvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That\u2019s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means\nour railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reducedgreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.\nOver time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is bettersituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required.", "rease, and BNSF should get its full\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is bettersituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, ourchecks will clear.\nLast year \u2013 in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy \u2013 we demonstrated our enthusiasm\nfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,$5.4 billion \u2013 or 90% of the total \u2013 was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad inthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a newrecord for capital spending \u2013 $8 billion \u2013 and spend allof the $2 billion increase in the United States.\nMoney will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.\nCommentators today often talk of \u201cgreat uncertainty.\u201d But think back, for example, to December 6,1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001.

Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull\u2019s-eye around wherever it lands.\nIn Berkshire\u2019s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,if we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves couldhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.\nThe challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn\u2019t possible.\nTo eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value \u2013 book value \u2013\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carryingvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we\u2019ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swingswildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.\nThe table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&P, a performance quite good in the earlier\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums ofcapital we currently manage eliminate anychance of exceptional performance.", "the earlier\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums ofcapital we currently manage eliminate anychance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for\nbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard.\nYearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of\nthe earth\u2019s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas oroperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year onadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amountproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many largeinvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road.\nTo provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly\nfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tellan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980s. The market\u2019s golden period,\nhowever, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relativeadvantage narrowed.\nAfter 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory\nperformance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absoluteresults.\nLooking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P \u2013 though that result is, of\ncourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results inbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.\n4\n\nBerkshire\u2019s Corporate Performance vs.", "we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results inbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.\n4\n\nBerkshire\u2019s Corporate Performance vs. the S&P 500 by Five-Year Periods\nAnnual Percentage Change\nFive-Year Periodin Per-Share\nBook Value of\nBerkshire\n(1)in S&P 500\nwith Dividends\nIncluded\n(2)Relative\nResults\n(1)-(2)\n1965-1969 ............................................... 17.2 5.0 12.2\n1966-1970 ............................................... 14.7 3.9 10.8\n1967-1971 ............................................... 13.9 9.2 4.7\n1968-1972 ............................................... 16.8 7.5 9.3\n1969-1973 ............................................... 17.7 2.0 15.7\n1970-1974 ............................................... 15.0 (2.4) 17.4\n1971-1975 ............................................... 13.9 3.2 10.7\n1972-1976 ............................................... 20.8 4.9 15.9\n1973-1977 ............................................... 23.4 (0.2) 23.6\n1974-1978 ............................................... 24.4 4.3 20.1\n1975-1979 ............................................... 30.1 14.7 15.4\n1976-1980 ............................................... 33.4 13.9 19.5\n1977-1981 ............................................... 29.0 8.1 20.9\n1978-1982 ............................................... 29.9 14.1 15.8\n1979-1983 ............................................... 31.6 17.3 14.3\n1980-1984 ............................................... 27.0 14.8 12.2\n1981-1985 ............................................... 32.6 14.6 18.0\n1982-1986 ............................................... 31.5 19.8 11.7\n1983-1987 ............................................... 27.4 16.4 11.0\n1984-1988 ............................................... 25.0 15.2 9.8\n1985-1989 ............................................... 31.1 20.3 10.8\n1986-1990 ...............................................", "4-1988 ............................................... 25.0 15.2 9.8\n1985-1989 ............................................... 31.1 20.3 10.8\n1986-1990 ............................................... 22.9 13.1 9.8\n1987-1991 ............................................... 25.4 15.3 10.1\n1988-1992 ............................................... 25.6 15.8 9.8\n1989-1993 ............................................... 24.4 14.5 9.9\n1990-1994 ............................................... 18.6 8.7 9.9\n1991-1995 ............................................... 25.6 16.5 9.1\n1992-1996 ............................................... 24.2 15.2 9.0\n1993-1997 ............................................... 26.9 20.2 6.7\n1994-1998 ............................................... 33.7 24.0 9.7\n1995-1999 ............................................... 30.4 28.5 1.9\n1996-2000 ............................................... 22.9 18.3 4.6\n1997-2001 ............................................... 14.8 10.7 4.1\n1998-2002 ............................................... 10.4 (0.6) 11.0\n1999-2003 ............................................... 6\n. 0 (0.6) 6.6\n2000-2004 ............................................... 8 . 0 (2.3) 10.3\n2001-2005 ............................................... 8 . 0 0 . 6 7 . 4\n2002-2006 ............................................... 13.1 6.2 6.9\n2003-2007 ............................................... 13.3 12.8 0.5\n2004-2008 ............................................... 6 . 9 (2.2) 9.1\n2005-2009 ............................................... 8 . 6 0 . 4 8 . 2\n2006-2010 ............................................... 10.0 2.3 7.7\nNotes: The first two periods cover the five years beginning September 30 of the previous year.

All other periods involve calendar years.\nThe other notes on page 2 also apply to this table.\n5\n\nIntrinsic Value \u2013 Today and Tomorrow\nThough Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can be\nmeasured. Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire\u2019s\nvalue.\nThe first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend these\ntotaled $158 billion at market value.\nInsurance float \u2013 money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us \u2013\nfunds $66 billion of our investments. This float is \u201cfree\u201d as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaningthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile,swinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we\u2019ve been significantlyprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of ourinvestments \u2013 those funded both by float and by retained earnings \u2013 can be viewed as an element of value forBerkshire shareholders.\nBerkshire\u2019s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\ninsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106.In Berkshire\u2019s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we\u2019veincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that willcontinue.\nThe following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business.", "lcontinue.\nThe following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investmentsapplicable to minority interests.\nYearend\nPer-Share\nInvestments PeriodCompounded Annual Increase\nin Per-Share Investments\n1970 ................... $ 6 6\n1980 ................... 7 5 4 1970-1980 27.5%\n1990 ................... 7,798 1980-1990 26.3%\n2000 ................... 50,229 1990-2000 20.5%\n2010 ................... 94,730 2000-2010 6.6%\nThough our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the\n40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operatingbusinesses.\nThe payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our\nnon-insurance businesses have increased, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests.\nYear Per-Share\nPre-Tax Earnings PeriodCompounded Annual Increase in\nPer-Share Pre-Tax Earnings\n1970 ............ $ 2.87\n1980 ............ 19.01 1970-1980 20.8%\n1990 ............ 102.58 1980-1990 18.4%\n2000 ............ 918.66 1990-2000 24.5%\n2010 ............ 5,926.04 2000-2010 20.5%\n6\n\nFor the forty years, our compounded annual gain in pre-tax, non-insurance earnings per share is 21.0%.\nDuring the same period, Berkshire\u2019s stock price increased at a rate of 22.1% annually. Over time, you can expect\nour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire\u2019s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsicvalue often follow very different paths \u2013 sometimes for extended periods \u2013 but eventually they meet.\nThere is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future.", "y meet.\nThere is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many otherbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presentlyemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dolla rs into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.\nThis \u201cwhat-will-they-do-with-the-money\u201d factor must always be evaluated along with the\n\u201cwhat-do-we-have-now\u201d calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company\u2019sintrinsic value. That\u2019s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of thecompany\u2019s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to thecompany\u2019s current value; if the CEO\u2019s talents or motives are suspect, today\u2019s value must be discounted. Thedifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck\u2019s or MontgomeryWard\u2019s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.\n************\nCharlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at a\ndecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from ourcurrent businesses and more major acquisitions. We\u2019re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my\ntrigger finger is itchy.\nPartially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a\ncadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They arevolunteers, not mercenaries.", "s who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They arevolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can\u2019t be luredaway.\nAt Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at\nheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years(it\u2019s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managersto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in peoplerather than process. A \u201chire well, manage little\u201d code suits both them and me.\nBerkshire\u2019s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MBAs; others never finished college. Some use\nbudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squadcomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required.\nOur second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the\nneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves toreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a\u201cuniverse\u201d for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.Competition for the few opportunities that areavailable tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, as\na girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be greatfor the girl, but terrible for the boys.\nAt Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition.", "errible for the boys.\nAt Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle \u2013 and frequently wecan\u2019t \u2013 we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others.\n7\n\nWhen I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn\u2019t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in\ntextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was to\npursue \u201copportunities\u201d to improve and expand the existing textile operation \u2013 so for years that\u2019s exactly what Idid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh!\nEventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries.\nThere is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the\nattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available inmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don\u2019t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculouslyhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securitiesand bide our time.\nOur flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We have\nbeen able to take money we earn from, say, See\u2019s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, butalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF.\nOur final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,\nculture counts.\nTo start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash.", "es,\nculture counts.\nTo start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide themdirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess upwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families ownBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire\u2019s actions and resultswith keen interest and an owner\u2019s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards.\nThis same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who have\nsought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to uswith an owner\u2019s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managerswho love their businesses is no small advantage.\nCultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, \u201cYou shape your houses and then they shape\nyou.\u201d That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperialcorporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, \u201cYou know you\u2019re no longer CEO when youget in the back seat of your car and it doesn\u2019t move.\u201d) At Berkshire\u2019s \u201cWorld Headquarters\u201d our annual rent is$270,212.

Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-techequipment \u2013 you name it \u2013 totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own,Berkshire\u2019s managers are likely to be careful with it as well.\nOur compensation programs, our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with an\neye to reinforcing the Berkshire culture, and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent.This culture grows stronger every year, and it will remain intact long after Charlie and I have left the scene.\nWe will need all of the strengths I\u2019ve just described to do reasonably well. Our managers will deliver;\nyou can count on that. But whether Charlie and I can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on thecompetitive environment for acquisitions. You will get our best efforts.\nGEICO\nNow let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far\nexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories.\nSixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a\n20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a\nonce-a-week class at the school.\n8\n\nOne day at the library, I checked out Ben\u2019s entry in Who\u2019s Who in America and found he was\nchairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had\nnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, afterreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train forWashington.\nAlas, when I arrived at the company\u2019s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared.", "rded an early train forWashington.\nAlas, when I arrived at the company\u2019s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I couldtalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.\nThat was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, \u201cDavy\u201d gave me an education about both\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated fromColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which gotme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon aftermeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.)\nSubsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got\ninto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened \u2013 with the stock falling bymore than 95% \u2013 Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the yearsincreased to 50% because of GEICO\u2019s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire\u2019s cost for this half of the businesswas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)\nWe then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside withBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, \u201cNext time, Warren, please make an appointment.\u201d)\nA lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal \u2013 saving Americans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance \u2013 remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 orwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder\u2019s business by deserving his business.", "icans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance \u2013 remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 orwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder\u2019s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this\nobjective, the company has grown to be America\u2019s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.\nWhen Tony Nicely, GEICO\u2019s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistentgrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.\nLet me quantify Tony\u2019s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn\u2019t already\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangiblenet worth of $1.9 billion.\nThe excess over tangible net worth of the implied value \u2013 $2.7 billion \u2013 was what we estimated\nGEICO\u2019s \u201cgoodwill\u201d to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholderswho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion inpremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO\u2019s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they wereannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinaryinsurer: Because of the company\u2019s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.\nToday, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICOincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic valuedecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick weapplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO\u2019s economic goodwill is about $14 billion.", "but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick weapplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO\u2019s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And thisvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO \u2013 off to a strong start in 2011 \u2013 is thegift that keeps giving.\n9\n\nOne not-so-small footnote: Under Tony, GEICO has developed one of the country\u2019s largest personal-\nlines insurance agencies , which primarily sells homeowners policies to our GEICO auto insurance customers. In\nthis business, we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. They take the risk; we simply sign\nup the customers. Last year we sold 769,898 new policies at this agency operation, up 34% from the year before.The obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue; equally important is the fact that itfurther strengthens our relationship with our policyholders, helping us retain them.\nI owe an enormous debt to Tony and Davy (and, come to think of it, to that janitor as well).\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\u2019ll present themas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\nWe will look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has propelled our\nexpansion over the years.\nInsurance\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\u2019s benefit.", "ver decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at thefollowing table:\nYearend\nFloat\n(in $ millions)\n1970 ........................................ $ 3 9\n1980 ........................................ 2 3 7\n1990 ........................................ 1,632\n2000 ........................................ 27,871\n2010 ........................................ 65,832\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at asignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\nFarm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss inseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\nAt Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwriteprofitably in most \u2013 though certainly not all \u2013 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better thancost-free.", "g been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwriteprofitably in most \u2013 though certainly not all \u2013 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better thancost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holdingits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\n10\n\nLet me emphasize again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\nindustry\u2019s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized byAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\u2019s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We\u2019ve already told you about GEICO,but we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way.\n************\nFirst off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one\nelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risksthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative than most large insurers\nin that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annualpremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion and\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By hisaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire.", "d\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By hisaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonitebounces off Ajit.\n************\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of allexposures\nthat might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if theappropriate premium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes hasled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. \u201cThe other guy is doing it so we must as well\u201d spellstrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.\n************\nFinally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, thefloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2010 2009 2010 2009\nGeneral Re ......................", "of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2010 2009 2010 2009\nGeneral Re ...................... $ 4 5 2 $ 4 7 7 $20,049 $21,014\nBH Reinsurance .................. 1 7 6 2 5 0 30,370 27,753\nGEICO ......................... 1,117 649 10,272 9,613\nOther Primary ................... 2 6 8 8 4 5,141 5,061\n$2,013 $1,460 $65,832 $63,441\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\u2019s impresses me as the best in the world.\n11\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came aboutbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics ofthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimesmy eyesight has been poor.\nMost of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let\u2019s look\nfirst at the record-breakers.\n\u2022 TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, withNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes arepedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI\u2019s exceptional performance is createdby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\n12\n\n\u2022 Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\nas well.", "\u2019s exceptional performance is createdby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\n12\n\n\u2022 Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\nas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter).\nThere\u2019s no need; Pete Liegl, the company\u2019s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products atthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one.\n\u2022 CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Report\nabout Vic Mancinelli, the company\u2019s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 millionfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt.Last year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. Whenwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878.\n\u2022 Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a new\nrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim hasbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by FrankRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golfcourse.\nA huge story in this sector\u2019s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can\u2019t overstate the\nbreadth and importance of Dave Sokol\u2019s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional\nownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five timesthat of its nearest competitor.

Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanicsand service personnel. This crew again did its job in 2010, with customer satisfaction, as delineated in our regularsurveys, hitting new highs.\nEven though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its\nacquisition in 1998, were a failure. In the 11 years through 2009, the company reported an aggregate pre-tax lossof $157 million, a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at NetJets were heavily subsidized by itsfree use of Berkshire\u2019s credit. Had NetJets been operating on a stand-alone basis, its loss over the years wouldhave been several hundreds of millions greater.\nWe are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire\u2019s guarantee. Despite this fee (which\ncame to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918 million from 2009.Dave\u2019s quick restructuring of management and the company\u2019s rationalization of its purchasing and spendingpolicies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was Berkshire\u2019s only major business problem into asolidly profitable operation.\nDave has meanwhile maintained NetJets\u2019 industry-leading reputation for safety and service. In many\nimportant ways, our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the FAA.Maintaining top-of-the-line standards is the right thing to do, but I also have a selfish reason for championing thispolicy. My family and I have flown more than 5,000 hours on NetJets (that\u2019s equal to being airborne 24 hours aday for seven months) and will fly thousands of hours more in the future.

We receive no special treatment andhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know weare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation.\nThe largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130\nbusinesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchaseof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase theremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmonwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership.\n13\n\nNext to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years.\nIn 2010, Grady Rosier\u2019s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billion\noperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, anoperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company\u2019s dynamic CEO. David isleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wineand Spirits in Tennessee.\nAt Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Sales\nare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar\u2019s main competitors.\nAll that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle.\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits arefar below the levels of a few years ago.", "home construction, however, continue to struggle.\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits arefar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010compared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400.\nA housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at some\npoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the pasteleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed nextyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. Thesebusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this\nletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nnot needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply coverstheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF\u2019s car loadings far off peak levels, thecompany\u2019s interest coverage was 6:1.\nBoth companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\ninvestments in plant and equipment.", "ar loadings far off peak levels, thecompany\u2019s interest coverage was 6:1.\nBoth companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\ninvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn therespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earnreasonable earnings on future capital investments.\nEarlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country\u2019s future. Rail moves 42% of\nAmerica\u2019s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad \u2013 about 28%of the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of allinter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S.\nis transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher.\nAll of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American\neconomy\u2019s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along withits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society\u2019s needs, notmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,with this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I\u2019m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our hugeincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin.\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \u201csocial compact.\u201d We are expected to put up ever-\nincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, weknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\n14\n\nMidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well.", "stments.\n14\n\nMidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport\n8% of the country\u2019s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day.\nMidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire\u2019s interest is 89.8%) and its\ncustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\u2019sperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recentreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since we\npurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state hasraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the twoutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told thatcomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area.\nMidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, more\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested orcommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmericanretains allof its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn.\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\nBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican.

CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressedand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010.\nAt Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry\u2019s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peak\nyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would havebeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 reportcontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed throughthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate theprice advantage that manufactured homes offer.\nWe finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore,\nshould be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country\u2019s home-loan practices.

But they want to stay in their homes, and generally they borrowed sensible amountsin relation to their income. In addition, we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account, whichmeans we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. If we were stupid in our lending, wewere going to\npay the price. That concentrates the mind.\nIf home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers, America would not have had the\ncrisis that it did. Our approach was simply to get a meaningful down-payment and gear fixed monthly payments\nto a sensible percentage of income. This policy kept Clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes.\nHome ownership makes sense for most Americans, particularly at today\u2019s lower prices and bargain\ninterest rates.

It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\u201cnormal\u201d earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find anopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can\u2019t come too soon for me: To updateAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozendividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, thoughconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strengthand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout.", "ughconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strengthand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don\u2019t fault the Fed: Forvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed\u2019s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from justthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, Iwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see our share ofCoke\u2019s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\nOverall, I believe our \u201cnormal\u201d investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.\n************\nLast summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 \u2013 an age Charlie and\nI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire \u2013 his call was a surprise.\nLou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been\ninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates onlybecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?\nLou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\ngreats.", "nd I have omitted updates onlybecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?\nLou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\ngreats. We will miss him.\n************\nFour years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren\u2019t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediatelyavailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.\nIt\u2019s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved iscrucial, as is the manager\u2019s understanding of \u2013 and sensitivity to \u2013 risk (which in no way should be measured bybeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with ahard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,we wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job.\n18\n\nWhen Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met byundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who havereceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with theirlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly startedanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their pastlosses.", "r earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly startedanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their pastlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire\u2019s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can resetannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like torequire style boxes such as \u201clong-short,\u201d \u201cmacro,\u201d \u201cinternational equities.\u201d At Berkshire our only style box is\u201csmart.\u201d)\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager\u2019s performance compensation be dependent on his or her ownportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big forindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a usefulperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted \u2013 but not to have a vote \u2013 on thewisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd\u2019s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was \u201clittle-known\u201d and expressed puzzlement that we didn\u2019t seek a \u201cbig-name.\u201d I wonderhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959.

Our goalwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops \u2013 that may not be the smartestmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)\nDerivatives\nTwo years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives\ncontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over at\nGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and theunwinding or expiration of some contracts.\nOur continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assumingrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions areidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front whenwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That\u2019s important.\nOur first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minorexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\nIn aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an \u201cunderwritingprofit,\u201d meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we wouldbenefit from the use of float.\n19\n\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession.", "be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we wouldbenefit from the use of float.\n19\n\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, itappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have hadthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged theright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.\nOur other large derivatives position \u2013 whose contracts go by the name of \u201cequity puts\u201d \u2013 involves\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in theU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&P 500 in the U.S.and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of thesecontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination datecounts: No payments can be required before then.\nAs a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originallyreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.Consequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend.", "million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that$647 million for about three years.\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\nThe future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 \u2013and foreign exchange rates are unchanged \u2013 we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to2026. You can call this amount \u201csettlement value.\u201d\nOn our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will recorda $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion andthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability willfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,of course, is far from a sure thing.\nWhat is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining \u201cfloat\u201d of $4.2 billion for an average of about\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance floatfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchaseof BNSF.\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral \u2013 a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged.", "o the purchaseof BNSF.\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral \u2013 a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feelingcomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.Foregoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.\nOn Reporting and Misreporting: The Numbers That Count and Those That Don\u2019t\nEarlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire and\nmeasuring its progress.\nLet\u2019s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net\nincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire.\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could \u2013 quite legally \u2013 cause net income in any\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like.\n20\n\nWe have that flexibility because realized gains or losses on investments go into the net income figure,\nwhereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a\n$10 billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses. Our net\nincome \u2013 which would count only the loss \u2013 would be reported as lessthan our operating income. If we had\nmeanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% when\nin reality our business might be much improved.\nIf we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because\nwe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I havenever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report.", "uge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I havenever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We both\nhave a deep disgust for \u201cgame playing\u201d with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate Americain the 1990s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to.\nOperating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how our\nbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But ifyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours.\nBoth realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.\nPay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on theright track.\n************\nAs a p.s., I can\u2019t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity puts\nhad a termination date of June 30, 2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties atthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figuredown to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contractsrequired us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change\nthat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million.\nBoth Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put ourmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts.", "te values when applied to\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put ourmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted thatthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.\nWe continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is\nthe accepted standard for option valuation \u2013 almost all leading business schools teach it \u2013 and we would beaccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with aninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy ofboth their values and ours were the two far apart.\nPart of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.\nCharlie and I can\u2019t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than thatcalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can\u2019t come up with an exact figure \u2013 anymore than we can come up with aprecise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn\u2019t\nbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime.", "be approximately right than precisely wrong.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime.

For that\nmatter, so does the academic\u2019s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as\nan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to\nvalue a business. That\u2019s what investing is all about.\nLife and Debt\nThe fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is\nequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.\nUnquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,\nthat\u2019s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you\u2019re\nclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, veryfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade \u2013 and some relearned in2008 \u2013 any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by asingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smartpeople.\nLeverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature.", "ven when it is employed by very smartpeople.\nLeverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, eitherbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met bypayment. For that, only cash will do the job.\nBorrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.\nWhen either is missing, that\u2019s allthat is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.\nIn September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously closeto bringing our entire country to its knees.\nCharlie and I have nointerest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire\u2019s well-\nbeing.

My grandfather\u2019s name was Ernest, andperhaps no man was more aptly named. No one worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped bythe experience.\nOn the facing page you can read a letter sent in 1939 by Ernest to his youngest son, my Uncle Fred.\nSimilar letters went to his other four children. I still have the letter sent to my Aunt Alice, which I found \u2013 alongwith $1,000 of cash \u2013 when, as executor of her estate, I opened her safe deposit box in 1970.\nErnest never went to business school \u2013 he never in fact finished high school \u2013 but he understood the\nimportance of liquidity as a condition for assured survival. At Berkshire, we have taken his $1,000 solution a bit\nfurther and have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash, excluding that held at our regulated utilityand railroad businesses. Because of that commitment, we customarily keep at least $20 billion on hand so that wecan both withstand unprecedented insurance losses (our largest to date having been about $3 billion from Katrina,the insurance industry\u2019s most expensive catastrophe) and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities,even during times of financial turmoil.\n22\n\n23\n\nWe keep our cash largely in U.S. Treasury bills and avoid other short-term securities yielding a few\nmore basis points, a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market funds\nbecame apparent in September 2008. We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe\u2019s observation, \u201cMore moneyhas been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.\u201d At Berkshire, we don\u2019t rely on bank lines, and wedon\u2019t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation toour liquid assets.\nFurthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past\n40 years.", "ostings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation toour liquid assets.\nFurthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past\n40 years. Instead, we have retained allof our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running\nabout $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those fourdecades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to buildingup its financial strength in this unrelenting way.\nBy being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of\nliquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in oureconomy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival.That\u2019s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30\nth.

It is totally unacceptable when evaluating amoral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that theycan\u2019t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter\nor a judge and see how far it gets them.\nIf you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.\nHowever, it\u2019s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it\u2019s too close to the lineand should be abandoned. There\u2019s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it\u2019squestionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.\nAs a corollary, let me know promptly if there\u2019s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news\nbut I don\u2019t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile.

(We have two superbback-up candidates as well.) When a transfer of responsibility is required, it will be seamless, andBerkshire\u2019s prospects will remain bright. More than 98% of my net worth is in Berkshire stock, all ofwhich will go to various philanthropies. Being so heavily concentrated in one stock defies conventionalwisdom.

James is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. Charlie and I are eagerto expand his managerial domain.\n\u2022 Our major businesses did well last year. In fact, each of our five largest non-insurance companies \u2013 BNSF,\nIscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy \u2013 delivered record operating earnings. Inaggregate these businesses earned more than $9 billion pre-tax in 2011. Contrast that to seven years ago,when we owned only one of the five, MidAmerican, whose pre-tax earnings were $393 million. Unless theeconomy weakens in 2012, each of our fabulous five should again set a record, with aggregate earnings\ncomfortably topping $10 billion.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\n\u2022 In total, our entire string of operating companies spent $8.2 billion for property, plant and equipment in\n2011, smashing our previous record by more than $2 billion. About 95% of these outlays were made inthe U.S., a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. Wewelcome projects abroad, but expect the overwhelming majority of Berkshire\u2019s future capitalcommitments to be in America.

This business produces \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 money that doesn\u2019t belong to us, but that we get toinvest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive inpremiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing.Though we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we\u2019ve now had nine consecutiveyears of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion. Over the same nine years our float increasedfrom $41 billion to its current record of $70 billion. Insurance has been good to us.\n\u2022 Finally, we made two major investments in marketable securities: (1) a $5 billion 6% preferred stock of\nBank of America that came with warrants allowing us to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 pershare any time before September 2, 2021; and (2) 63.9 million shares of IBM that cost us $10.9 billion.Counting IBM, we now have large ownership interests in four exceptional companies: 13.0% ofAmerican Express, 8.8% of Coca-Cola, 5.5% of IBM and 7.6% of Wells Fargo. (We also, of course,have many smaller, but important, positions.)\nWe view these holdings as partnership interests in wonderful businesses, not as marketable securities to\nbe bought or sold based on their near-term prospects. Our share of their earnings, however, are far from\nfully reflected in ourearnings; only the dividends we receive from these businesses show up in our\nfinancial reports. Over time, though, the undistributed earnings of these companies that are attributableto our ownership are of huge importance to us. That\u2019s because they will be used in a variety of ways toincrease future earnings and dividends of the investee. They may also be devoted to stock repurchases,which will increase our share of the company\u2019s future earnings.\nHad we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the \u201cBig Four\u201d would\nhave been $862 million.", "ck repurchases,which will increase our share of the company\u2019s future earnings.\nHad we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the \u201cBig Four\u201d would\nhave been $862 million. That\u2019s all that would have been reported in Berkshire\u2019s income statement. Ourshare of this quartet\u2019s earnings, however, would have been far greater: $3.3 billion. Charlie and Ibelieve that the $2.4 billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value forBerkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. We expect the combined earnings of the four \u2013 andtheir dividends as well \u2013 to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time tocome. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earningsof $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us.\nI\u2019ve run out of good news. Here are some developments that hurt us during 2011:\n\u2022 A few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, an\nelectric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake \u2013 a bigmistake. In large measure,\nthe company\u2019s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase andremains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since ourpurchase, the company\u2019s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. Wewrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year.\nAt yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at present\nlevels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our currentcarrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or evenall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities whenI purchased the bonds.", "ubstantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or evenall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities whenI purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman.\n4\n\n\u2022 Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called away from us by their issuers in\n2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeemsecurities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That\u2019s a lot ofincome to replace, though our Lubrizol purchase did offset most of it.\n\u2022 Last year, I told you that \u201ca housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.\u201d I was dead\nwrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. Theconnection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country,accounting for about 7% of those constructed during 2011.\nAdditionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products,\nprimarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. Inaggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That\u2019ssimilar to 2010 but down from $1.8 billion in 2006.\nHousing will come back \u2013 you can be sure of that. Over time, the number of housing units necessarily\nmatches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period ofyears prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, weended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy.That created still another problem for housing: Early in a recession, household formations slow, and in2009 the decrease was dramatic.\nThat devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households\nthan housing units.", "in a recession, household formations slow, and in2009 the decrease was dramatic.\nThat devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households\nthan housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormonestake over. And while \u201cdoubling-up\u201d may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living within-laws can quickly lose its allure.\nAt our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts \u2013 considerably less than the number of new\nhouseholds being formed \u2013 buyers and renters are sopping up what\u2019s left of the old oversupply. (Thisprocess will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varieswidely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter,employing only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of theeconomy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in adepression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely\nlagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy.\nWise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don\u2019t\ncreate households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our marketsystem will restore the needed balance \u2013 probably before long. When that day comes, we will againbuild one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how farunemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776:America\u2019s best days lie ahead.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nCharlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic business\nvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks.", "rlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic business\nvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If itdoesn\u2019t, we are overpaid at any price.\nWe have no way to pinpoint intrinsic value. But we do have a useful, though considerably understated ,\nproxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however,book value very roughly tracks business values. That\u2019s because the amount by which Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic valueexceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, thedivergence will likely become ever more substantial in absolute terms, remaining reasonably steady, however, ona percentage basis as both the numerator and denominator of the business-value/book-value equation increase.\n5\n\nWe\u2019ve regularly emphasized that our book-value performance is almost certain to outpace the S&P 500\nin a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong up-year. The test is how we doover time. Last year\u2019s annual report included a table laying out results for the 42 five-year periods since we tookover at Berkshire in 1965 (i.e., 1965-69, 1966-70, etc.). All showed our book value beating the S&P, and ourstring held for 2007-11. It will almost certainly snap, though, if the S&P 500 should put together a five-yearwinning streak (which it may well be on its way to doing as I write this).\n************\nI also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you\nestimate our per-share intrinsic value. I won\u2019t repeat the full discussion here; you can find it reproduced onpages 99-100.", "ast year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you\nestimate our per-share intrinsic value. I won\u2019t repeat the full discussion here; you can find it reproduced onpages 99-100. To update the tables shown there, our per-share investments in 2011 increased 4% to $98,366, andour pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 18% to $6,990 per share.\nCharlie and I like to see gains in both areas, but our primary focus is on building operating earnings. Over\ntime, the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings, and we hope also to purchase somelarge operations that will give us a further boost. We now have eight subsidiaries that would each be included in theFortune 500 were they stand-alone companies. That leaves only 492 to go. My task is clear, and I\u2019m on the prowl.\nShare Repurchases\nLast September, we announced that Berkshire would repurchase its shares at a price of up to 110% of book\nvalue. We were in the market for only a few days \u2013 buying $67 million of stock \u2013 before the price advanced beyondour limit. Nonetheless, the general importance of share repurchases suggests I should focus for a bit on the subject.\nCharlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to take\ncare of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to thecompany\u2019s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated.\nWe have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course,\ninfractions \u2013 even serious ones \u2013 are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In otherinstances, a less benign conclusion seems warranted. It doesn\u2019t suffice to say that repurchases are being made tooffset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholdersarehurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value.", "at repurchases are being made tooffset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholdersarehurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation \u2013 whether the\nmoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases \u2013 is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. (OneCEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; Irecommend that you read his annual letter.)\nCharlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We like\nmaking money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset \u2013 ourown stock \u2013 that we know to be worth at least x for less than that \u2013 for .9x, .8x or even lower. (As one of our\ndirectors says, it\u2019s like shooting fish in a barrel, after the barrel has been drained and the fish have quit flopping.)\nNevertheless, we don\u2019t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the sellingshareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying,therefore, we want those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of the assets they are selling.\nAt our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic\nvalue. And the more and the cheaper we buy, the greater the gain for continuing shareholders. Therefore, if giventhe opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know,however, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets.Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion.", "d know,however, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets.Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strengththat is unquestionable takes precedence over all else.\n************\nThis discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors\nto changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for twoevents: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time tocome; and second, we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. A corollary to\nthis second point: \u201cTalking our book\u201d about a stock we own \u2013 were that to be effective \u2013 would actually beharmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume.\n6\n\nLet\u2019s use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano\ndid a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Theiroperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.\nBut their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company\u2019s\nfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, askill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, madevalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.\nToday, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.\nNaturally, what happens to the company\u2019s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares.", "ally, what happens to the company\u2019s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for theday: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?\nI won\u2019t keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM\u2019s stock price to languish throughout the five years.\nLet\u2019s do the math. If IBM\u2019s stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire\n250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and wewould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-yearperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding afterfive years, of which we would own 6.5%.\nIf IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100\nmillion greater under the \u201cdisappointing\u201d scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higherprice. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $1\n1\u20442billion more than if the \u201chigh-price\u201d\nrepurchase scenario had taken place.\nThe logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own\nmoney or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks\nrise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions , however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance.", "se. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions , however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemblea commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day\u2019s supply.\nCharlie and I don\u2019t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking \u2013 we\u2019ve observed enough\nhuman behavior to know the futility of that \u2013 but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And herea confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of BenGraham\u2019s The Intelligent Investor , the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock\nprices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was oneof the luckiest moments in my life.\nIn the end, the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. But\nan important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it islikely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I willabandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet\nand income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\u2019ll presentthem as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. Because we may be repurchasingBerkshire shares from some of you, we will offer our thoughts in each section as to how intrinsic value comparesto carrying value.\n7\n\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later.", "s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. Thiscollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322011 70,571\nIt\u2019s unlikely that our float will grow much \u2013 if at all \u2013 from its current level. That\u2019s mainly because we\nalready have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. Were there to be a decline in float, I will add,\nit would almost certainly be very gradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy\nresult creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole tooperate at a significant underwriting loss. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and a well-managed\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years.", "a significant underwriting loss. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and a well-managed\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There area lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine\nconsecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue tounderwrite profitably in most \u2013 though certainly not all \u2013 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will bebetter than cost-free. We will profit just as we would if some party deposited $70.6 billion with us, paid us a feefor holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\nSo how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a\nliability in calculating Berkshire\u2019s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable toreplenish it. But that\u2019s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Iffloat is both costless and long-enduring, the true value of this liability is farlower than the accounting liability.\nPartially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d attributable to our insurance\ncompanies that is included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for thefloat-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its\ntrue value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill assetattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case at Berkshire.", "business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill assetattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what wewould pay to purchase float of similar quality \u2013 to be far in excess of its historic\ncarrying value. The value of our float is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsicbusiness value substantially exceeds book value.\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry\nas a whole: We don\u2019t think there is much \u201cBerkshire-quality\u201d float existing in the insurance world. In most years,including 2011, the industry\u2019s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\n8\n\nindustry\u2019s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\u2019s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you aboutthe major units.\n************\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire torisks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in that respect than\nmost large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from somemega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anything it has ever faced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record amoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings.", "llion loss from somemega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anything it has ever faced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record amoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers andreinsurers would be far in the red, and some would face insolvency.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion and\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By theseaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladlytrade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none.\n************\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on business\nthat their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it so we must as well,\u201d spellstrouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Indeed, a good underwriter needs an independentmindset akin to that of the senior citizen who received a call from his wife while driving home. \u201cAlbert, be careful,\u201dshe warned, \u201cI just heard on the radio that there\u2019s a car going the wrong way down the Interstate.\u201d \u201cMabel, theydon\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cIt\u2019s not just one car, there are hundreds of them.\u201d\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results.", "te.\u201d \u201cMabel, theydon\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cIt\u2019s not just one car, there are hundreds of them.\u201d\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s\nhuge float has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue tobe. In the first few years after we acquired it, General Re was a major headache. Now it\u2019s a treasure.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 61 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 50 years of service in 2011.\nGEICO\u2019s much-envied record comes from Tony\u2019s brilliant execution of a superb and almost-\nimpossible-to-replicate business model. During Tony\u2019s 18-year tenure as CEO, our market share has grown from 2.0%to 9.3%. If it had instead remained static \u2013 as it had for more than a decade before he took over \u2013 our premium volumewould now be $3.3 billion rather than the $15.4 billion we attained in 2011. The extra value created by Tony and hisassociates is a major element in Berkshire\u2019s excess of intrinsic value over book value.\nThere is still more than 90% of the auto-insurance market left for GEICO to rake in. Don\u2019t bet against\nTony acquiring chunks of it year after year in the future. Our low costs permit low prices, and every day moreAmericans discover that the Gecko is doing them a favor when he urges them to visit GEICO.com for a quote.(Our lizard has another endearing quality: Unlike human spokesmen or spokeswomen who expensively representother insurance companies, our little fellow has no agent.)\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of\nthem plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently beenprofitable and the float they provide us is substantial.", "of smaller companies, most of\nthem plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently beenprofitable and the float they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\n9\n\nAt yearend, we acquired Princeton Insurance, a New Jersey writer of medical malpractice policies. This\nbolt-on transaction expands the managerial domain of Tim Kenesey, the star CEO of Medical Protective, our\nIndiana-based med-mal insurer. Princeton brings with it more than $600 million of float, an amount that isincluded in the following table.\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2011 2010 2011 2010\nBH Reinsurance ................ $(714) $ 176 $33,728 $30,370\nGeneral Re .................... 1 4 4 4 5 2 19,714 20,049\nGEICO ....................... 5 7 6 1,117 11,169 10,272\nOther Primary .................. 2 4 2 2 6 8 5,960 5,141\n$ 248 $2,013 $70,571 $65,832\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\u2019s impresses me as the best in the world.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our many other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own sectorin this letter and also split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our\ncredit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amplycovers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF\u2019s interestcoverage was 9.5x.", "sses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amplycovers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF\u2019s interestcoverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under allcircumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and adiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body.\nMeasured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America\u2019s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than\nany other railroad \u2013 about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of allinter-city\nton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as thecirculatory system of our economy. Your railroad is the largest artery.\nAll of this places a huge responsibility on us. We must, without fail, maintain and improve our 23,000\nmiles of track along with 13,000 bridges, 80 tunnels, 6,900 locomotives and 78,600 freight cars. This job requiresus to have ample financial resources under alleconomic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantly\nand effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature, such as the widespread flooding BNSF labored under lastsummer.\nTo fulfill its societal obligation, BNSF regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge, with the\nexcess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays.Though many people decry our country\u2019s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be leviedagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money \u2013 funds from the private sector \u2013 into the investment projects\nneeded to provide better and more extensive service in the future.", "sm cannot be leviedagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money \u2013 funds from the private sector \u2013 into the investment projects\nneeded to provide better and more extensive service in the future. If railroads were not making these hugeexpenditures, our country\u2019s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion andmaintenance problems than exist today.\nMassive investments of the sort that BNSF is making would be foolish if it could not earn appropriate\nreturns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers.Many years ago Ben Franklin counseled, \u201cKeep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.\u201d Translating this to ourregulated businesses, he might today say, \u201cTake care of your customer, and the regulator \u2013 your customer\u2019srepresentative \u2013 will take care of you.\u201d Good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return.\n10\n\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \u201csocial compact.\u201d We are expected to put up ever-increasing\nsums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently,we know that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\nMidAmerican, 89.8% owned by Berkshire, supplies 2.5 million customers in the U.S. with electricity,\noperating as the largest supplier in Iowa, Utah and Wyoming and as an important provider in six other states aswell. Our pipelines transport 8% of the country\u2019s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend onus every day. They haven\u2019t been disappointed.\nWhen MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\u2019s performance as\na pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent report,Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. In the most recent survey of customer\nsatisfaction, MidAmerican\u2019s U.S.", "second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. In the most recent survey of customer\nsatisfaction, MidAmerican\u2019s U.S. utilities ranked second among 60 utility groups surveyed. The story was fardifferent not many years back when MidAmerican acquired these properties.\nMidAmerican will have 3,316 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2012, far more\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that we have invested or committed towind is a staggering $6 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican retains allof its\nearnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. In addition, late last year we took ontwo solar projects \u2013 one 100%-owned in California and the other 49%-owned in Arizona \u2013 that will cost about $3billion to construct. Many more wind and solar projects will almost certainly follow.\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\nBNSF and by Greg Abel at MidAmerican.

These errors came about because I misjudgedeither the competitive strength of the business being purchased or the future economics of the industry in which itoperated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes my eyesight has beenpoor. Charlie\u2019s has been better; he voted no more than \u201cpresent\u201d on several of my errant purchases.\nBerkshire\u2019s newer shareholders may be puzzled over our decision to hold on to my mistakes. After all,\ntheir earnings can never be consequential to Berkshire\u2019s valuation, and problem companies require moremanagerial time than winners. Any management consultant or Wall Street advisor would look at our laggards andsay \u201cdump them.\u201d\nThat won\u2019t happen. For 29 years, we have regularly laid out Berkshire\u2019s economic principles in these\nreports (pages 93-98) and Number 11 describes our general reluctance to sell poor performers (which, in mostcases, lag because of industry factors rather than managerial shortcomings). Our approach is far from Darwinian,and many of you may disapprove of it. I can understand your position. However, we have made \u2013 and continue tomake \u2013 a commitment to the sellers of businesses we buy that we will retain those businesses through thick andthin. So far, the dollar cost of that commitment has not been substantial and may well be offset by the goodwill itbuilds among prospective sellers looking for the right permanent home for their treasured business and loyalassociates. These owners know that what they get with us can\u2019t be delivered by others and that our commitmentswill be good for many decades to come.\n12\n\nPlease understand, however, that Charlie and I are neither masochists nor Pollyannas. If either of the\nfailings we set forth in Rule 11 is present \u2013 if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term, or if laborstrife is endemic \u2013 we will take prompt and decisive action.", "f either of the\nfailings we set forth in Rule 11 is present \u2013 if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term, or if laborstrife is endemic \u2013 we will take prompt and decisive action. Such a situation has happened only a couple of times inour 47-year history, and none of the businesses we now own is in straits requiring us to consider disposing of it.\n************\nThe steady and substantial comeback in the U.S. economy since mid-2009 is clear from the earnings\nshown at the front of this section. This compilation includes 54 of our companies. But one of these, Marmon, isitself the owner of 140 operations in eleven distinct business sectors. In short, when you look at Berkshire, youare looking across corporate America. So let\u2019s dig a little deeper to gain a greater insight into what has happenedin the last few years.\nThe four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carried\nunder Finance and Financial Products) had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $227 million in 2009, $362 million in2010 and $359 million in 2011. If you subtract these earnings from those in the combined statement, you will seethat our multiple and diverse non-housing operations earned $1,831 million in 2009, $3,912 million in 2010 and\n$4,678 million in 2011. About $291 million of the 2011 earnings came from the Lubrizol acquisition. The profileof the remaining 2011 earnings \u2013 $4,387 million \u2013 illustrates the comeback of much of America from thedevastation wrought by the 2008 financial panic. Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergencyroom, most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored.\n************\nAlmost all of our managers delivered outstanding performances last year, among them those managers\nwho run housing-related businesses and were therefore fighting hurricane-force headwinds. Here are a few examples:\n\u2022 Vic Mancinelli again set a record at CTB, our agricultural equipment operation.", "rs\nwho run housing-related businesses and were therefore fighting hurricane-force headwinds. Here are a few examples:\n\u2022 Vic Mancinelli again set a record at CTB, our agricultural equipment operation. We purchased CTB in\n2002 for $139 million. It has subsequently distributed $180 million to Berkshire, last year earned $124million pre-tax and has $109 million in cash. Vic has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions over theyears, including a meaningful one he signed up after yearend.\n\u2022 TTI, our electric components distributor, increased its sales to a record $2.1 billion, up 12.4% from\n2010. Earnings also hit a record, up 127% from 2007, the year in which we purchased the business. In2011, TTI performed far better than the large publicly-traded companies in its field. That\u2019s no surprise:Paul Andrews and his associates have been besting them for years. Charlie and I are delighted that Paulnegotiated a large bolt-on acquisition early in 2012. We hope more follow.\n\u2022 Iscar, our 80%-owned cutting-tools operation, continues to amaze us. Its sales growth and overall\nperformance are unique in its industry. Iscar\u2019s managers \u2013 Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman \u2013 are brilliant strategists and operators. When the economic world was cratering in November2008, they stepped up to buy Tungaloy, a leading Japanese cutting-tool manufacturer. Tungaloysuffered significant damage when the tsunami hit north of Tokyo last spring. But you wouldn\u2019t knowthat now: Tungaloy went on to set a sales record in 2011. I visited the Iwaki plant in November andwas inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm of Tungaloy\u2019s management, as well as its staff. They area wonderful group and deserve your admiration and thanks.\n\u2022 McLane, our huge distribution company that is run by Grady Rosier, added important new customers in\n2011 and set a pre-tax earnings record of $370 million.", "p and deserve your admiration and thanks.\n\u2022 McLane, our huge distribution company that is run by Grady Rosier, added important new customers in\n2011 and set a pre-tax earnings record of $370 million. Since its purchase in 2003 for $1.5 billion, thecompany has had pre-tax earnings of $2.4 billion and also increased its LIFO reserve by $230 millionbecause the prices of the retail products it distributes (candy, gum, cigarettes, etc.) have risen. Gradyruns a logistical machine second to none. You can look for bolt-ons at McLane, particularly in our newwine-and-spirits distribution business.\n13\n\n\u2022 Jordan Hansell took over at NetJets in April and delivered 2011 pre-tax earnings of $227 million. That\nis a particularly impressive performance because the sale of new planes was slow during most of theyear. In December, however, there was an uptick that was more than seasonally normal. Howpermanent it will be is uncertain.\nA few years ago NetJets was my number one worry: Its costs were far out of line with revenues, and\ncash was hemorrhaging. Without Berkshire\u2019s support, NetJets would have gone broke. These problemsare behind us, and Jordan is now delivering steady profits from a well-controlled and smoothly-runningoperation. NetJets is proceeding on a plan to enter China with some first-class partners, a move thatwill widen our business \u201cmoat.\u201d No other fractional-ownership operator has remotely the size andbreadth of the NetJets operation, and none ever will. NetJets\u2019 unrelenting focus on safety and servicehas paid off in the marketplace.\n\u2022 It\u2019s a joy to watch Marmon\u2019s progress under Frank Ptak\u2019s leadership. In addition to achieving internal\ngrowth, Frank regularly makes bolt-on acquisitions that, in aggregate, will materially increase Marmon\u2019searning power. (He did three, costing about $270 million, in the last few months.) Joint ventures aroundthe world are another opportunity for Marmon.", "t, in aggregate, will materially increase Marmon\u2019searning power. (He did three, costing about $270 million, in the last few months.) Joint ventures aroundthe world are another opportunity for Marmon. At midyear Marmon partnered with the Kundalia familyin an Indian crane operation that is already delivering substantial profits. This is Marmon\u2019s secondventure with the family, following a successful wire and cable partnership instituted a few years ago.\nOf the eleven major sectors in which Marmon operates, ten delivered gains in earnings last year. You\ncan be confident of higher earnings from Marmon in the years ahead.\n\u2022 \u201cBuy commodities, sell brands\u201d has long been a formula for business success. It has produced\nenormous and sustained profits for Coca-Cola since 1886 and Wrigley since 1891. On a smaller scale,we have enjoyed good fortune with this approach at See\u2019s Candy since we purchased it 40 years ago.\nLast year See\u2019s had record pre-tax earnings of $83 million, bringing its total since we bought it to $1.65\nbillion. Contrast that figure with our purchase price of $25 million and our yearend carrying-value (netof cash) of less than zero. (Yes, you read that right; capital employed at See\u2019s fluctuates seasonally,hitting a low after Christmas.) Credit Brad Kinstler for taking the company to new heights since hebecame CEO in 2006.\n\u2022 Nebraska Furniture Mart (80% owned) set an earnings record in 2011, netting more than ten times what\nit did in 1983, when we acquired our stake.\nBut that\u2019s not the big news. More important was NFM\u2019s acquisition of a 433-acre tract north of Dallas\non which we will build what is almost certain to be the highest-volume home-furnishings store in thecountry. Currently, that title is shared by our two stores in Omaha and Kansas City, each of which hadrecord-setting sales of more than $400 million in 2011. It will be several years before the Texas store iscompleted, but I look forward to cutting the ribbon at the opening.", "as City, each of which hadrecord-setting sales of more than $400 million in 2011. It will be several years before the Texas store iscompleted, but I look forward to cutting the ribbon at the opening. (At Berkshire, the managers do thework; I take the bows.)\nOur new store, which will offer an unequalled variety of merchandise sold at prices that can\u2019t be\nmatched, will bring huge crowds from near and far. This drawing power and our extensive holdings ofland at the site should enable us to attract a number of other major stores. (If any high-volume retailersare reading this, contact me.)\nOur experience with NFM and the Blumkin family that runs it has been a real joy. The business was\nbuilt by Rose Blumkin (known to all as \u201cMrs. B\u201d), who started the company in 1937 with $500 and adream. She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, shedied the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)\nMrs. B\u2019s son, Louie, now 92, helped his mother build the business after he returned from World War II\nand, along with his wife, Fran, has been my friend for 55 years. In turn, Louie\u2019s sons, Ron and Irv, havetaken the company to new heights, first opening the Kansas City store and now gearing up for Texas.\n14\n\nThe \u201cboys\u201d and I have had many great times together, and I count them among my best friends. The\nBlumkins are a remarkable family. Never inclined to let an extraordinary gene pool go to waste, I amrejoicing these days because several members of the fourth Blumkin generation have joined NFM.\nOverall, the intrinsic value of the businesses in this Berkshire sector significantly exceeds their book\nvalue. For many of the smaller companies, however, this is not true. I have made more than my share of mistakesbuying small companies. Charlie long ago told me, \u201cIf something\u2019s not worth doing at all, it\u2019s not worthdoing well,\u201d and I should have listened harder.", "true.

Charlie long ago told me, \u201cIf something\u2019s not worth doing at all, it\u2019s not worthdoing well,\u201d and I should have listened harder. In any event, our large purchases have generally workedwell \u2013 extraordinarily well in a few cases \u2013 and overall this sector is a winner for us.\n************\nCertain shareholders have told me they hunger for more discussions of accounting arcana. So here\u2019s a\nbit of GAAP-mandated nonsense I hope both of them enjoy.\nCommon sense would tell you that our varied subsidiaries should be carried on our books at their cost\nplus the earnings they have retained since our purchase (unless their economic value has materially decreased, inwhich case an appropriate write-down must be taken). And that\u2019s essentially the reality at Berkshire \u2013 except forthe weird situation at Marmon.\nWe purchased 64% of the company in 2008 and put this interest on our books at our cost, $4.8 billion.\nSo far, so good. Then, in early 2011, pursuant to our original contract with the Pritzker family, we purchased anadditional 16%, paying $1.5 billion as called for by a formula that reflected Marmon\u2019s increased value. In thisinstance, however, we were required to immediately write off $614 million of the purchase price retroactive tothe end of 2010. (Don\u2019t ask!) Obviously, this write-off had no connection to economic reality. The excess ofMarmon\u2019s intrinsic value over its carrying value is widened by this meaningless write-down.\nFinance and Financial Products\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and\nClayton Homes, the country\u2019s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes.", "inancial Products\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and\nClayton Homes, the country\u2019s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-ownedsubsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in BerkadiaCommercial Mortgage.\nIt\u2019s instructive to look at what transpired at our three operating businesses after the economy fell off a\ncliff in late 2008, because their experiences illuminate the fractured recovery that later came along.\nResults at our two leasing companies mirrored the \u201cnon-housing\u201d economy. Their combined pre-tax\nearnings were $13 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010 and $155 million in 2011, an improvement reflecting thesteady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton\u2019s world ofmanufactured housing (just like site-built housing) has endured a veritable depression, experiencing no recoveryto date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in2011. (When housing was booming in 2005, they were 146,744.)\nDespite these difficult times, Clayton has continued to operate profitably, largely because its mortgage\nportfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufacturedhomes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, you might expect us to sufferheavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies \u2013 meaningful downpayments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income \u2013 Clayton has kept losses toacceptable levels. It has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time.\nAs is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price.", "ve had negative equity for some time.\nAs is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructivebehavior \u2013 government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly wasthe almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dipswould be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housingtransactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to \u201cmonetize\u201d the increased value of their homes byrefinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemedgreat fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have \u201clost\u201d their house throughforeclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash inexcess of their cost. In these cases, the evicted homeowner was the winner, and the victim was the lender.)\n15\n\nIn 2007, the bubble burst, just as all bubbles must. We are now in the fourth year of a cure that, though\nlong and painful, is sure to succeed. Today, household formations are consistently exceeding housing starts.\nClayton\u2019s earnings should improve materially when the nation\u2019s excess housing inventory is worked\noff. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does notdiffer materially from their book value.\nInvestments\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion.\n12/31/11\nShares CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ............. 13.0 $ 1,287 $ 7,151\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ................ 8 . 8 1,299 13,994\n29,100,937 ConocoPhillips ........................ 2 .", "s)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ............. 13.0 $ 1,287 $ 7,151\n200,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company ................ 8 . 8 1,299 13,994\n29,100,937 ConocoPhillips ........................ 2 . 3 2,027 2,121\n63,905,931 International Business Machines Corp. ..... 5 . 5 10,856 11,751\n31,416,127 Johnson & Johnson ..................... 1 . 2 1,880 2,060\n79,034,713 Kraft Foods Inc. ....................... 4 . 5 2,589 2,953\n20,060,390 Munich Re ........................... 11.3 2,990 2,464\n3,947,555 POSCO .............................. 5 . 1 7 6 8 1,301\n72,391,036 The Procter & Gamble Company .......... 2 . 6 4 6 4 4,829\n25,848,838 Sanofi ............................... 1 . 9 2,055 1,900\n291,577,428 Tesco plc ............................. 3 . 6 1,719 1,827\n78,060,769 U.S. Bancorp ......................... 4 . 1 2,401 2,112\n39,037,142 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ................... 1 . 1 1,893 2,333\n400,015,828 Wells Fargo & Company ................ 7 . 6 9,086 11,024\nOthers ............................... 6,895 9,171\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .... $48,209 $76,991\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \u201ccost\u201d differs in a few cases because of\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.\nWe made few changes in our investment holdings during 2011.

Its earnings are strong, its\nassets solid and its capital at record levels. At Bank of America, some huge mistakes were made by priormanagement.

Concurrently, he is nurturing a huge and attractive underlying business thatwill endure long after today\u2019s problems are forgotten. Our warrants to buy 700 million Bank of America shareswill likely be of great value before they expire.\nAs was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the IBM party. I have\nbeen reading the company\u2019s annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn\u2019t until a Saturday in March lastyear that my thinking crystallized.

Each of them receives 80% of his performance compensation from his own results and 20% from hispartner\u2019s. When our quarterly filings report relatively small holdings, these are not likely to be buys I made(though the media often overlook that point) but rather holdings denoting purchases by Todd or Ted.\n16\n\nOne additional point about these two new arrivals. Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next CEO\nof Berkshire in making acquisitions. They have excellent \u201cbusiness minds\u201d that grasp the economic forces likelyto determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding ofwhat is predictable and what is unknowable.\n************\nThere is little new to report on our derivatives positions, which we have described in detail in past reports.\n(Annual reports since 1977 are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com.) One important industry change,however, must be noted: Though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements, the rules havechanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shuncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral.", "s, the rules havechanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shuncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. The possibility of some sudden and hugeposting requirement \u2013 arising from an out-of-the-blue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terroristattack \u2013 is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength.\nOur insurance-like derivatives contracts, whereby we pay if various issues included in high-yield bond\nindices default, are coming to a close. The contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired, and theremainder will terminate soon. In 2011, we paid out $86 million on two losses, bringing our total payments to$2.6 billion. We are almost certain to realize a final \u201cunderwriting profit\u201d on this portfolio because the premiumswe received were $3.4 billion, and our future losses are apt to be minor. In addition, we will have averaged about$2 billion of float over the five-year life of these contracts. This successful result during a time of great creditstress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk.\nCharlie and I continue to believe that our equity-put positions will produce a significant profit, considering\nboth the $4.2 billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the $222 million profit we\u2019ve alreadyrealized on contracts that we repurchased. At yearend, Berkshire\u2019s book value reflected a liability of $8.5 billion forthe remaining contracts; if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been $6.2 billion.\nThe Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer\nInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving\nmore money in the future.", "2 billion.\nThe Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer\nInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving\nmore money in the future. At Berkshire we take a more demanding approach, defining investing as the transfer toothers of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power \u2013 after taxes\nhave been paid on nominal gains \u2013 in the future. More succinctly, investing is forgoing consumption now in\norder to have the ability to consume more at a later date.\nFrom our definition there flows an important corollary: The riskiness of an investment is notmeasured\nby beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by theprobability \u2013 the reasoned probability \u2013 of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing-power over his\ncontemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonablycertain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a non-fluctuatingasset can be laden with risk.\nInvestment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it\u2019s\nimportant to understand the characteristics of each. So let\u2019s survey the field.\n\u2022 Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages,\nbank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as \u201csafe.\u201dIn truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. Their beta may be zero, but their risk is huge.\nOver the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This uglyresult, moreover, will forever recur.", "have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This uglyresult, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemicforces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time suchpolicies spin out of control.\nEven in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86%\nin value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buywhat $1 did at that time. Consequently, a tax-free institution would have needed 4.3% interest annuallyfrom bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers wouldhave been kidding themselves if they thought of anyportion of that interest as \u201cincome.\u201d\n17\n\nFor tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year\nperiod, continuous rolling of U.S. Treasury bills produced 5.7% annually. That sounds satisfactory. Butif an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return wouldhave yielded nothing in the way of real income. This investor\u2019s visible income tax would have stripped\nhim of 1.4 points of the stated yield, and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining4.3 points. It\u2019s noteworthy that the implicit inflation \u201ctax\u201d was more than triple the explicit income taxthat our investor probably thought of as his main burden. \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d may be imprinted on ourcurrency, but the hand that activates our government\u2019s printing press has been all too human.\nHigh interest rates, of course, can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currency-based\ninvestments \u2013 and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not comeclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume.", "ace with currency-based\ninvestments \u2013 and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not comeclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with awarning label.\nUnder today\u2019s conditions, therefore, I do not like currency-based investments. Even so, Berkshire holds\nsignificant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ampleliquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted, however inadequate rates may be.\nAccommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can becounted on for liquidity under the most chaotic of economic conditions. Our working level for liquidityis $20 billion; $10 billion is our absolute minimum.\nBeyond the requirements that liquidity and regulators impose on us, we will purchase currency-related\nsecurities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain \u2013 either because a particular credit ismispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers thepossibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we\u2019veexploited both opportunities in the past \u2013 and may do so again \u2013 we are now 180 degrees removed fromsuch prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seemsapt: \u201cBonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.\u201d\n\u2022 The second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are\npurchased in the buyer\u2019s hope that someone else \u2013 who also knows that the assets will be foreverunproductive \u2013 will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite ofsuch buyers in the 17\nthcentury.\nThis type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they\nbelieve the buying pool will expand still further.", "e a favorite ofsuch buyers in the 17\nthcentury.\nThis type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they\nbelieve the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are notinspired by what the asset itself can\nproduce \u2013 it will remain lifeless forever \u2013 but rather by the belief that others will desire it even moreavidly in the future.\nThe major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other\nassets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however,has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has someindustrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable ofsoaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will stillown one ounce at its end.\nWhat motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the\npast decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generatedadditional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.As \u201cbandwagon\u201d investors join any party, they create their own truth \u2013 for a while .\nOver the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses\nthat can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In thesebubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the \u201cproof\u201d delivered by the market,and the pool of buyers \u2013 for a time \u2013 expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubblesblown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: \u201cWhat the wiseman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.\u201d\n18\n\nToday the world\u2019s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons.", "gh inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: \u201cWhat the wiseman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.\u201d\n18\n\nToday the world\u2019s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it\nwould form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At$1,750 per ounce \u2013 gold\u2019s price as I write this \u2013 its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.\nLet\u2019s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy allU.S. cropland (400\nmillion acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world\u2019s mostprofitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we wouldhave about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buyingbinge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?\nBeyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today\u2019s annual\nproduction of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers \u2013 whether jewelry and industrial users,frightened individuals, or speculators \u2013 must continually absorb this additional supply to merelymaintain an equilibrium at present prices.\nA century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn,\nwheat, cotton, and other crops \u2013 and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever thecurrency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to itsowners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16Exxons). The\n170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You canfondle the cube, but it will not respond.\nAdmittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it\u2019s likely many will still rush to gold.", "d in size and still incapable of producing anything. You canfondle the cube, but it will not respond.\nAdmittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it\u2019s likely many will still rush to gold. I\u2019m\nconfident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century ata rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.\n\u2022 Our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapse\ndrives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currencycollapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard \u201ccash is king\u201d in late 2008, justwhen cash should have been deployed rather than held. Similarly, we heard \u201ccash is trash\u201d in the early1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On thoseoccasions, investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort.\nMy own preference \u2013 and you knew this was coming \u2013 is our third category: investment in productive\nassets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability ininflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring aminimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola, IBMand our own See\u2019s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies \u2013 think of ourregulated utilities, for example \u2013 fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. Toearn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior tononproductive or currency-based assets.\nWhether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper\n(as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Colaor some See\u2019s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S.", "seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper\n(as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Colaor some See\u2019s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S. population will move more goods, consume morefood, and require more living space than it does now. People will forever exchange what they producefor what others produce.\nOur country\u2019s businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens.\nMetaphorically, these commercial \u201ccows\u201d will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of \u201cmilk\u201dto boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity todeliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows, just as theydid during the 20\nthcentury when the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 (and paid loads of dividends as\nwell). Berkshire\u2019s goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses. Our first choice will beto own them in their entirety \u2013 but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts ofmarketable stocks. I believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove tobe the runaway winner among the three we\u2019ve examined. More important, it will be by far the safest.\n19\n\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 5that the CenturyLink Center (renamed from\n\u201cQwest\u201d). Last year, Carrie Kizer debuted as the ringmaster and earned a lifetime assignment. Everyone lovedthe job she did \u2013 especially me.\nSoon after the 7 a.m. opening of the doors, we will have a new activity: The Newspaper Tossing Challenge.\nLate last year, Berkshire purchased the Omaha World-Herald and, in my meeting with its shareholder-employees,I told of the folding and throwing skills I developed while delivering 500,000 papers as a teenager.\nI immediately saw skepticism in the eyes of the audience. That was no surprise to me.", "er-employees,I told of the folding and throwing skills I developed while delivering 500,000 papers as a teenager.\nI immediately saw skepticism in the eyes of the audience. That was no surprise to me. After all, the\nreporters\u2019 mantra is: \u201cIf your mother says she loves you, check it out.\u201d So now I have to back up my claim. Atthe meeting, I will take on all comers in making 35-foot tosses of the World-Herald to a Clayton porch. Anychallenger whose paper lands closer to the doorstep than mine will receive a dilly bar. I\u2019ve asked Dairy Queen tosupply several for the contest, though I doubt that any will be needed. We will have a large stack of papers. Grabone. Fold it (no rubber bands). Take your best shot. Make my day.\nAt 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink\u2019s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\u2019s question periods,please do so while Charlie is talking.\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot\nhall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did yourpart, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,249 pairs of Justin boots, 11,254pounds of See\u2019s candy, 8,000 Quikut knives (that\u2019s 15 knives per minute) and 6,126 pairs of Wells Lamontgloves, a Marmon product whose very existence was news to me. (The product I focus on is money.) But you cando better. Remember: Anyone who says money can\u2019t buy happiness simply hasn\u2019t shopped at our meeting.\nAmong the new exhibitors this year will be Brooks, our running-shoe company. Brooks has been\ngobbling up market share and in 2011 had a sales gain of 34%, its tenth consecutive year of record volume.

Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least half of you, I believe we can.\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new\nones. I recommend MiTek , an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. You\u2019ll learn how my\ninterest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose Icouldn\u2019t fathom. Since we bought MiTek in 2001, it has made 33 \u201ctuck-in\u201d acquisitions, almost all successful. Ithink you\u2019ll also like a short book that Peter Bevelin has put together explaining Berkshire\u2019s investment andoperating principles. It sums up what Charlie and I have been saying over the years in annual reports and atannual meetings. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\nIf you are a big spender \u2013 or aspire to become one \u2013 visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday.

Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha.

These analysts willbring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience.\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the marketclose on a Friday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts.

If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its\nresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nIn 2012, Berkshire achieved a total gain for its shareholders of $24.1 billion. We used $1.3 billion of that\nto repurchase our stock, which left us with an increase in net worth of $22.8 billion for the year. The per-share book\nvalue of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 14.4%.", "billion of that\nto repurchase our stock, which left us with an increase in net worth of $22.8 billion for the year. The per-share book\nvalue of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 14.4%. Over the last 48 years (that is, since presentmanagement took over), book value has grown from $19 to $114,214, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\nA number of good things happened at Berkshire last year, but let\u2019s first get the bad news out of the way.\n\u0160When the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year inwhich we had a gain of $24.1 billion would be subpar, in terms of the comparison we present on the facingpage.\nBut subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire\u2019s percentage increase in book value was less\nthan the S&P\u2019s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). Ineight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&P had a gain of 15% or more. We do better when thewind is in our face.\nTo date, we\u2019ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the\nS&P over such a stretch. (The record is on page 103.) But the S&P has now had gains in each of the lastfour years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-year wins will end.\nOne thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire\u2019s results, my partner Charlie Munger, the\ncompany\u2019s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It\u2019s our jobto increase intrinsic business\nvalue \u2013 for which we use book value as a significantly understated proxy \u2013 at a faster rate than the market\ngains of the S&P. If we do so, Berkshire\u2019s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itselfoutpace the S&P over time.", "ignificantly understated proxy \u2013 at a faster rate than the market\ngains of the S&P. If we do so, Berkshire\u2019s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itselfoutpace the S&P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, whothemselves can earn S&P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.\nCharlie and I believe the gain in Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value will over time likely surpass the S&P returns bya small margin. We\u2019re confident of that because we have some outstanding businesses, a cadre of terrificoperating managers and a shareholder-oriented culture. Our relative performance, however, is almostcertain to be better when the market is down or flat. In years when the market is particularly strong, expectus to fall short.\n\u0160The second disappointment in 2012 was my inability to make a major acquisition. I pursued a couple ofelephants, but came up empty-handed.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nOur luck, however, changed early this year. In February, we agreed to buy 50% of a holding company that\nwill own all of H. J. Heinz. The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge PauloLemann, a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist.\nWe couldn\u2019t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinarymanager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holdingcompany. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferredhas two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significantpremium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holdingcompany\u2019s common stock for a nominal sum.\nOur total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year.", "ed also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holdingcompany\u2019s common stock for a nominal sum.\nOur total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year. But we stillhave plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip. So it\u2019s back to work; Charlie and I have againdonned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants.\nNow to some good news from 2012:\n\u0160Last year I told you that BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy \u2013 our five most\nprofitable non-insurance companies \u2013 were likely to earn more than $10 billion pre-tax in 2012. Theydelivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our\u201cpowerhouse five\u201d had aggregate earnings of $10.1 billion, about $600 million more than in 2011.\nOf this group, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire eight years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased theamount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simplygrowing, but rather increasing per-share results.\nUnless the U.S. economy tanks \u2013 which we don\u2019t expect \u2013 our powerhouse five should again deliver higher\nearnings in 2013. The five outstanding CEOs who run them will see to that.\n\u0160Though I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We hada record year for \u201cbolt-on\u201d purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded intoour existing businesses.", "ition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We hada record year for \u201cbolt-on\u201d purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded intoour existing businesses. These transactions were completed without Berkshire issuing anyshares.\nCharlie and I love these acquisitions: Usually they are low-risk, burden headquarters not at all, and expand\nthe scope of our proven managers.\n\u0160Our insurance operations shot the lights out last year. While giving Berkshire $73 billion of freemoney to\ninvest, they also delivered a $1.6 billion underwriting gain, the tenth consecutive year of profitableunderwriting. This is truly having your cake and eating it too.\nGEICO led the way, continuing to gobble up market share without sacrificing underwriting discipline.Since 1995, when we obtained control, GEICO\u2019s share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.5% to9.7%. Premium volume meanwhile increased from $2.8 billion to $16.7 billion. Much more growth liesahead.\nThe credit for GEICO\u2019s extraordinary performance goes to Tony Nicely and his 27,000 associates. And to\nthat cast, we should add our Gecko. Neither rain nor storm nor gloom of night can stop him; the little lizardjust soldiers on, telling Americans how they can save big money by going to GEICO.com.\nWhen I count my blessings, I count GEICO twice.\n4\n\n\u0160Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our new investment managers, have proved to be smart, models of\nintegrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio management, and a perfect cultural fit. Wehit the jackpot with these two. In 2012 each outperformed the S&P 500 by double-digit margins.\nThey left me in\nthe dust as well .\nConsequently, we have increased the funds managed by each to almost $5 billion (some of this emanating\nfrom the pension funds of our subsidiaries). Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manageBerkshire\u2019s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene.", "ion (some of this emanating\nfrom the pension funds of our subsidiaries). Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manageBerkshire\u2019s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene. You can rest easy when theytake over.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s yearend employment totaled a record 288,462 (see page 106 for details), up 17,604 from lastyear. Our headquarters crew, however, remained unchanged at 24. No sense going crazy.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo \u2013 all had goodyears. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchasedadditional shares of Wells Fargo (our ownership now is 8.7% versus 7.6% at yearend 2011) and IBM (6.0%versus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentageownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from13.0% to 13.7%.\nBerkshire\u2019s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Mae West had itright: \u201cToo much of a good thing can be wonderful.\u201d\nThe four companies possess marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented.

At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us asignificant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate.\nGoing by our yearend share count, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2012 earnings amounted to $3.9 billion.\nIn the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.1 billion.But make no mistake: The $2.8 billion of earnings we do not report is every bit as valuable to us as whatwe record.\nThe earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases \u2013 which enhance our share of\nfuture earnings \u2013 and also for funding business opportunities that are usually advantageous. Over time weexpect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshirewill increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled$26.7 billion at yearend).\n\u0160There was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried \u201cuncertainty\u201d when faced with capital-allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings andcash). At Berkshire, we didn\u2019t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant andequipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That\u2019s 19% more than we spent in 2011, ourprevious high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits aresaying. We instead heed the words from Gary Allan\u2019s new country song, \u201cEvery Storm Runs Out of Rain.\u201d\nWe will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expendituresin 2013.", "ed the words from Gary Allan\u2019s new country song, \u201cEvery Storm Runs Out of Rain.\u201d\nWe will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expendituresin 2013. Opportunities abound in America.\n************\nA thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced theunknown since 1776. It\u2019s just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always existwhile at other times they ignore them (usually because the recent past has been uneventful).\n5\n\nAmerican business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied\nto business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game thatis heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20\nth\nCentury, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression andmany recessions. And don\u2019t forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the centuryas well.)\nSince the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it\u2019s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out\nof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of \u201cexperts,\u201d or the ebb and flow of businessactivity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.\nMy own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when\nthe U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day\u2019s headlines told of moresetbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail.\nThe country\u2019s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per\ncapita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been\nuncertain.", "uccess since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per\ncapita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been\nuncertain. America\u2019s destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance.\nIf you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries,\ncall Berkshire. Let us unburden you.\n************\nIn summary, Charlie and I hope to build per-share intrinsic value by (1) improving the earning power of our\nmany subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) participating in the growthof our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsicvalue; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if\never, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\nwill continue to play major roles in the American economy. Insurance, moreover, will always be essential for bothbusinesses and individuals \u2013 and no company brings greater resources to that arena than Berkshire. As we viewthese and other strengths, Charlie and I like your company\u2019s prospects.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\nis for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements \u2013 one of which was qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019sintrinsic value.", "any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements \u2013 one of which was qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 104-105.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to\n$113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased15.7% to $8,085.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and our\nper-share earnings figure has grown at a 20.8% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to seegains in both areas, but our strong emphasis will always be on building operating earnings.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\u2019ll present themas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\n6\n\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\nas those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others.Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float.", "ire\u2019s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322012 73,125\nLast year I told you that our float was likely to level off or even decline a bit in the future. Our insurance\nCEOs set out to prove me wrong and did, increasing float last year by $2.5 billion. I now expect a further increase\nin 2013. But further gains will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\u2019s float will almost certainly grow. InNational Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 2% in any year.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. That\u2019s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay youinterest.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011.", "try pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Theirfinancials for 2012 are not yet available.) There are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry neverceases searching for new ones.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. If we do, our float will be better than free money.\nSo how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is\ncalculated, the fullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were\nunable to replenish it. But that\u2019s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolvingfund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire\u2019s will be, the true value of this liability isdramatically less than the accounting liability.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true\nvalue. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill assetcarried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\n7\n\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance\ngoodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality \u2013t ob e\nfar in excess of its historic carrying value.", "e true economic value of our insurance\ngoodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality \u2013t ob e\nfar in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believeBerkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: There is very little \u201cBerkshire-quality\u201d float existing in the insurance world. In 37 of the 45 years ending in2011, the industry\u2019s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry\u2019soverall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by Americanindustry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.\nA further unpleasant reality adds to the industry\u2019s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting\nfrom \u201clegacy\u201d bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvestedduring the next few years \u2013 and perhaps for many years beyond that. Today\u2019s bond portfolios are, in effect, wastingassets. Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some\nextraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no\none else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportant, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers.", "e in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe\u2013 a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profitfor the year because it has so many streams of earnings. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhilebe far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $35 billion and a\nsignificant cumulative underwriting profit, a feat that no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. He hasthus added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. If you meet Ajit at the annual meeting, bowdeeply.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\n8\n\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.", "l four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be. Weare particularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has achievedconsistent and profitable growth since we acquired the company in 1998.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 62 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony Nicely,\nwho joined the company at 18 and completed 51 years of service in 2012.\nI rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record was\nconsiderably better than is indicated by GEICO\u2019s GAAP underwriting profit of $680 million. Because of a changein accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO\u2019s underwriting earnings of$410 million. This item had nothing to do with 2012\u2019s operating results, changing neither cash, revenues, expenses\nnor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO\u2019s intrinsic valueand the value at which we carry it on our books.\nGEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss in\nhistory. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained fromKatrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, astaggering number reflecting GEICO\u2019s leading market share in the New York metropolitan area.\nLast year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders\n(\u201cpersistency\u201d) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (\u201cclosures\u201d). Big dollars ride on thosetwo factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than$1 billion.", "quotations that resulted in sales (\u201cclosures\u201d). Big dollars ride on thosetwo factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than$1 billion. GEICO\u2019s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company\u2019s prices, they usuallyfind they can save important sums. (Give us a try at 1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com. Be sure to mention that you are ashareholder; that fact will usually result in a discount.)\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies have consistently deliveredan underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us with substantial float. Charlie andI treasure these companies and their managers.\nLate in 2012, we enlarged this group by acquiring Guard Insurance, a Wilkes-Barre company that writes\nworkers compensation insurance, primarily for smaller businesses. Guard\u2019s annual premiums total about $300million. The company has excellent prospects for growth in both its traditional business and new lines it has begunto offer.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2012 2011 2012 2011\nBH Reinsurance ......... $ 3 0 4 $(714) $34,821 $33,728\nGeneral Re ............. 3 5 5 1 4 4 20,128 19,714\nGEICO ................ 680* 576 11,578 11,169\nOther Primary .......... 2 8 6 2 4 2 6,598 5,960\n$1,625 $ 248 $73,125 $70,571\n*After a $410 million charge against earnings arising from an industry-wide accounting change.\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\u2019s impresses me as the best in the world.", "248 $73,125 $70,571\n*After a $410 million charge against earnings arising from an industry-wide accounting change.\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\u2019s impresses me as the best in the world.

Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each business has earning power that even under terrible conditions amply covers its interestrequirements. In last year\u2019s tepid economy, for example, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage was 9.6x. (Our definition ofcoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.)\nAt MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: thecompany\u2019s recession-resistant earnings, which result from our exclusively offering an essential service, and its greatdiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n\u0160BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline.", "two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n\u0160BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nmaking BNSF the most important artery in our economy\u2019s circulatory system.\nBNSF also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly way, carrying aton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on the same job guzzle aboutfour times as much fuel.\n\u0160MidAmerican\u2019s electric utilities serve regulated retail customers in ten states. Only one utility holdingcompany serves more states. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: first, from a standing start nineyears ago, we now account for 6% of the country\u2019s wind generation capacity. Second, when we completethree projects now under construction, we will own about 14% of U.S. solar-generation capacity.\nProjects like these require huge capital investments. Upon completion, indeed, our renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $13 billion. We relish making such commitments if they promise reasonable returns \u2013 and on thatfront, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\nmassive investment in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. And it is in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\nOur managers must think today of what the country will need far down the road. Energy and transportation\nprojects can take many years to come to fruition; a growing country simply can\u2019t afford to get behind the curve.\nWe have been doing our part to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.", "nergy and transportation\nprojects can take many years to come to fruition; a growing country simply can\u2019t afford to get behind the curve.\nWe have been doing our part to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Whatever you may have heard about our\ncountry\u2019s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America\u2019s rail system hasnever been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however, resting on ourlaurels: BNSF will spend about $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, roughly double its depreciation charge and morethan any railroad has spent in a single year.\n10\n\nIn Matt Rose, at BNSF, and Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, we have two outstanding CEOs.

At that\ntime, I focused on MidAmerican\u2019s utility operations and barely noticed HomeServices, which then owned only afew real estate brokerage companies.\nSince then, however, the company has regularly added residential brokers \u2013 three in 2012 \u2013 and now has\nabout 16,000 agents in a string of major U.S. cities.

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude somepurchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in thismanner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the real expenses and profits ofthe businesses aggregated in the table.\nI won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are small and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should\nunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such asthe amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realexpenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded asexpenses when calculating earnings \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpoint they could not be more different.\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $600 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal\u201d \u2013 and indeedthat is the portion we have included in the table above \u2013 and the rest not. This difference has become significantbecause of the many acquisitions we have made.\n\u201cNon-real\u201d amortization expense also looms large at some of our major investees. IBM has made many\nsmall acquisitions in recent years and now regularly reports \u201cadjusted operating earnings,\u201d a non-GAAP figure thatexcludes certain purchase-accounting adjustments. Analysts focus on this number, as they should.\n12\n\nA \u201cnon-real\u201d amortization charge at Wells Fargo, however, is not highlighted by the company and never, to\nmy knowledge, has been noted in analyst reports.", "ts focus on this number, as they should.\n12\n\nA \u201cnon-real\u201d amortization charge at Wells Fargo, however, is not highlighted by the company and never, to\nmy knowledge, has been noted in analyst reports.

Some of the\nbusinesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25%\nafter-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poorreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation.\nMore than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price\nthan to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimesreverted to my old habit of bargain-hunting, with results ranging from tolerable to terrible. Fortunately, my mistakeshave usually occurred when I made smaller purchases. Our large acquisitions have generally worked out well and,in a few cases, more than well.\nViewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ\n$22.6 billion of net tangible assets and, on that base, earned 16.3% after-tax.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive.

We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for intangible assets. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of the businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying valueby a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the huge winners reside.\n************\nMarmon provides an example of a clear and substantial gap existing between book value and intrinsic\nvalue. Let me explain the odd origin of this differential.\nLast year I told you that we had purchased additional shares in Marmon, raising our ownership to 80% (up\nfrom the 64% we acquired in 2008). I also told you that GAAP accounting required us to immediately record the2011 purchase on our books at far less than what we paid. I\u2019ve now had a year to think about this weird accountingrule, but I\u2019ve yet to find an explanation that makes anysense \u2013 nor can Charlie or Marc Hamburg, our CFO, come\nup with one. My confusion increases when I am told that if we hadn\u2019t already owned 64%, the 16% we purchasedin 2011 would have been entered on our books at our cost.\nIn 2012 (and in early 2013, retroactive to yearend 2012) we acquired an additional 10% of Marmon and the\nsame bizarre accounting treatment was required. The $700 million write-off we immediately incurred had no effecton earnings but did reduce book value and, therefore, 2012\u2019s gain in net worth.\nThe cost of our recent 10% purchase implies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own.\nOur balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchaserepresents excellent value.", "ies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own.\nOur balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchaserepresents excellent value. If we are correct, our Marmon holding is worth at least $4.6 billion more than itscarrying value.\nMarmon is a diverse enterprise, comprised of about 150 companies operating in a wide variety of\nindustries. Its largest business involves the ownership of tank cars that are leased to a variety of shippers, such as oiland chemical companies. Marmon conducts this business through two subsidiaries, Union Tank Car in the U.S. andProcor in Canada.\n13\n\nUnion Tank Car has been around a long time, having been owned by the Standard Oil Trust until that\nempire was broken up in 1911. Look for its UTLX logo on tank cars when you watch trains roll by. As a Berkshireshareholder, you own the cars with that insignia. When you spot a UTLX car, puff out your chest a bit and enjoy thesame satisfaction that John D. Rockefeller undoubtedly experienced as he viewed hisfleet a century ago.\nTank cars are owned by either shippers or lessors, not by railroads. At yearend Union Tank Car and Procor\ntogether owned 97,000 cars having a net book value of $4 billion. A new car, it should be noted, costs upwards of$100,000. Union Tank Car is also a major manufacturer of tank cars \u2013 some of them to be sold but most to beowned by it and leased out. Today, its order book extends well into 2014.\nAt both BNSF and Marmon, we are benefitting from the resurgence of U.S. oil production. In fact, our\nrailroad is now transporting about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, roughly 10% of the total produced in the \u201clower 48\u201d(i.e. not counting Alaska and offshore).

Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in BerkadiaCommercial Mortgage.\nWe include Clayton in this sector because it owns and services 332,000 mortgages, totaling $13.7 billion.\nIn large part, these loans have been made to lower and middle-income families. Nevertheless, the loans haveperformed well throughout the housing collapse, thereby validating our conviction that a reasonable down paymentand a sensible payments-to-income ratio will ward off outsized foreclosure losses, even during stressful times.\nClayton also produced 25,872 manufactured homes last year, up 13.5% from 2011. That output accounted\nfor about 4.8% of all single-family residences built in the country, a share that makes Clayton America\u2019s numberone homebuilder.\nCORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. Our expenditures for new rental equipment at\nXTRA totaled $256 million in 2012, more than double its depreciation expense.

We do not include holdings of the pension funds in our annual reporttabulations, though their portfolios often overlap Berkshire\u2019s.\n************\nWe continue to wind down the part of our derivatives portfolio that involved the assumption by Berkshire\nof insurance-like risks. (Our electric and gas utility businesses, however, will continue to use derivatives foroperational purposes.) New commitments would require us to post collateral and, with minor exceptions, we areunwilling to do that.

We also\nreceived very substantial sums upfront on these derivatives, and the \u201cfloat\u201d attributable to them has averaged about$2 billion over their five-year lives. All told, these derivatives have provided a more-than-satisfactory result,especially considering the fact that we were guaranteeing corporate credits \u2013 mostly of the high-yield variety \u2013throughout the financial panic and subsequent recession.\nIn our other major derivatives commitment, we sold long-term puts on four leading stock indices in the\nU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts were initiated between 2004 and 2008 and even under the worst ofcircumstances have only minor collateral requirements. In 2010 we unwound about 10% of our exposure at a profitof $222 million. The remaining contracts expire between 2018 and 2026. Only the index value at expiration datecounts; our counterparties have no right to early termination.\nBerkshire received premiums of $4.2 billion when we wrote the contracts that remain outstanding. If all of\nthese contracts had come due at yearend 2011, we would have had to pay $6.2 billion; the corresponding figure atyearend 2012 was $3.9 billion. With this large drop in immediate settlement liability, we reduced our GAAPliability at yearend 2012 to $7.5 billion from $8.5 billion at the end of 2011. Though it\u2019s no sure thing, Charlie and Ibelieve it likely that the final liability will be considerably less than the amount we currently carry on our books. Inthe meantime, we can invest the $4.2 billion of float derived from these contracts as we see fit.\nWe Buy Some Newspapers . . . Newspapers?\nDuring the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million.", "e $4.2 billion of float derived from these contracts as we see fit.\nWe Buy Some Newspapers . . . Newspapers?\nDuring the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may\npuzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that thecirculation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still\nholds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements foracquisitions.\nWe can address the second point easily. Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense ,\nwill buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widgetcompany. Addressing the first point requires me to provide a more elaborate explanation, including some history.\nNews, to put it simply, is what people don\u2019t know that they want to know. And people will seek their news\n\u2013 what\u2019s important to them \u2013 from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access,\nreliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of thenews and the person wanting it.\nBefore television and the Internet, newspapers were the primary source for an incredible variety of news, a\nfact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests wereinternational, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latestinformation. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money\u2019s worth, evenif only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests.", "ell you the latestinformation. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money\u2019s worth, evenif only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost allof the product\u2019s cost, and readers rode their coattails.\nAdditionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect\nproviding even more \u201cnews.\u201d Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs orapartments were available, what supermarkets were carrying which weekend specials, or what movies were showingwhere and when was far more important than the views expressed on the editorial page.\n16\n\nIn turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they\nrequired a \u201cmegaphone\u201d to tell the city\u2019s residents why their stores should be visited today . Indeed, big department\nstores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods theyadvertised would fly off the shelves. With no other megaphone remotely comparable to that of the newspaper, adssold themselves.\nAs long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary;\nwhether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, \u201cIowe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions \u2013 nepotism and monopoly.\u201d)\nOver the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that\njoined forces to operate as a single economic unit). This contraction was inevitable because most people wished toread and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulationalmost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads.", "for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulationalmost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads. This symbioticprocess spelled doom for the weaker paper and became known as \u201csurvival of the fattest.\u201d\nNow the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news\nlong before the presses begin to roll. The Internet offers extensive information about both available jobs and homes.Television bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another,newspapers have therefore lost their \u201cprimacy.\u201d And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenuesfrom \u201chelp wanted\u201d classified ads \u2013 long a huge source of income for newspapers \u2013 have plunged more than 90% inthe past 12 years.)\nNewspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what\u2019s\ngoing on in your town \u2013 whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football \u2013 there is no substitute\nfor a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader\u2019s eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphsabout Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors willbe read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informationalneeds of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents.\nEven a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. And that process has\nbeen underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers \u2013 including Berkshire in Buffalo \u2013have offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen.", "ring the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers \u2013 including Berkshire in Buffalo \u2013have offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen. How couldthis lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation,moreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of the pastreverses.\nThe Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette , published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over\nthe past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. DespiteWalter\u2019s powerful example, it\u2019s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire\u2019s, haveexplored pay arrangements. Whatever works best \u2013 and the answer is not yet clear \u2013 will be copied widely.\n************\nCharlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound\ncommunities andhaving a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that\nsuccess will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coveragewill almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in somelarge towns or cities \u2013 while it may improve profits in the short term \u2013 seems certain to diminish the papers\u2019relevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paidappropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet.\n17\n\nOur confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger\u2019s outstanding management group at the\nOmaha World-Herald , a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers.", "ernet.\n17\n\nOur confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger\u2019s outstanding management group at the\nOmaha World-Herald , a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers,\nhowever, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailiesthat endorsed a presidential candidate, 10 opted for Romney.)\nOur newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward.\nStill, the six small dailies we owned throughout 2012 had unchanged revenues for the year, a result far superior tothat experienced by big-city dailies. Moreover, the two large papers we operated throughout the year \u2013 The Buffalo\nNews and the Omaha World-Herald \u2013 held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.\nAmong newspapers in America\u2019s 50 largest metropolitan areas, our Buffalo and Omaha papers rank near the top incirculation penetration of their home territories.\nThis popularity is no accident: Credit the editors of those papers \u2013 Margaret Sullivan at the News and Mike\nReilly at the World-Herald \u2014 for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable to\ncommunity-interested readers. (Margaret, I regret to say, recently left us to join The New York Times , whose job\noffers are tough to turn down. That paper made a great hire, and we wish her the best.)\nBerkshire\u2019s cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensible\nInternet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meetor exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief.\nCharlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not\ncontinue the operation of anybusiness doomed to unending losses.", "ults to date support that belief.\nCharlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not\ncontinue the operation of anybusiness doomed to unending losses. One daily paper that we acquired in a bulk\npurchase from Media General was significantly unprofitable under that company\u2019s ownership. After analyzing thepaper\u2019s results, we saw no remedy for the losses and reluctantly shut it down. All of our remaining dailies, however,should be profitable for a long time to come. (They are listed on page 108.) At appropriate prices \u2013 and thatmeans at a very low multiple of current earnings \u2013 we will purchase more papers of the type we like.\n************\nA milestone in Berkshire\u2019s newspaper operations occurred at yearend when Stan Lipsey retired as publisher\nofThe Buffalo News . It\u2019s no exaggeration for me to say that the News might now be extinct were it not for Stan.\nCharlie and I acquired the News in April 1977. It was an evening paper, dominant on weekdays but lacking\na Sunday edition. Throughout the country, the circulation trend was toward morning papers. Moreover, Sundaywas becoming ever more critical to the profitability of metropolitan dailies. Without a Sunday paper, the News was\ndestined to lose out to its morning competitor, which had a fat and entrenched Sunday product.\nWe therefore began to print a Sunday edition late in 1977. And then all hell broke loose. Our competitor\nsued us, and District Judge Charles Brieant, Jr. authored a harsh ruling that crippled the introduction of our paper.His ruling was later reversed \u2013 after 17 long months \u2013 in a 3-0 sharp rebuke by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.While the appeal was pending, we lost circulation, hemorrhaged money and stood in constant danger of going out ofbusiness.\nEnter Stan Lipsey, a friend of mine from the 1960s, who, with his wife, had sold Berkshire a small Omaha\nweekly.", "t circulation, hemorrhaged money and stood in constant danger of going out ofbusiness.\nEnter Stan Lipsey, a friend of mine from the 1960s, who, with his wife, had sold Berkshire a small Omaha\nweekly. I found Stan to be an extraordinary newspaperman, knowledgeable about every aspect of circulation,production, sales and editorial. (He was a key person in gaining that small weekly a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.) Sowhen I was in big trouble at the News , I asked Stan to leave his comfortable way of life in Omaha to take over in\nBuffalo.\nHe never hesitated. Along with Murray Light, our editor, Stan persevered through four years of very dark\ndays until the News won the competitive struggle in 1982. Ever since, despite a difficult Buffalo economy, the\nperformance of the News has been exceptional. As both a friend and as a manager, Stan is simply the best.\n18\n\nDividends\nA number of Berkshire shareholders \u2013 including some of my good friends \u2013 would like Berkshire to pay a\ncash dividend. It puzzles them that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns,but pay out nothing ourselves. So let\u2019s examine when dividends do and don\u2019t make sense for shareholders.\nA profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A\ncompany\u2019s management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business \u2013 projects tobecome more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economicmoat separating the company from its competitors.\nI ask the managers of our subsidiaries to unendingly focus on moat-widening opportunities, and they find\nmany that make economic sense. But sometimes our managers misfire. The usual cause of failure is that they startwith the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process issubconscious; that\u2019s what makes it so dangerous.\nYour chairman has not been free of this sin.", "ith the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process issubconscious; that\u2019s what makes it so dangerous.\nYour chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshire\u2019s 1986 annual report, I described how twenty\nyears of management effort and capital improvements in our original textile business were an exercise in futility. Iwanted the business to succeed and wished my way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought another New\nEngland textile company.) But wishing makes dreams come true only in Disney movies; it\u2019s poison in business.\nDespite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether they\ncan be intelligently deployed in our various businesses. Our record $12.1 billion of fixed-asset investments and bolt-\non acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we havean advantage: Because we operate in so many areas of the economy, we enjoy a range of choices far wider than thatopen to most corporations. In deciding what to do, we can water the flowers and skip over the weeds.\nEven after we deploy hefty amounts of capital in our current operations, Berkshire will regularly generate a\nlot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses.Here our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholderswealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition?\nI have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is\nsatisfactory, which means that our shareholders are farwealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for\nacquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.\nBut, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results.", "hey would be if the funds we used for\nacquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.\nBut, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That\u2019s particularly\ntrue at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is nowmore difficult than it has been during most of our years.\nNevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF is\na case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the fundsrequired for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though largetransactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.\nThe third use of funds \u2013 repurchases \u2013 is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful\ndiscount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds\nintelligently: It\u2019s hard to go wrong when you\u2019re buying dollar bills for 80\u00a2 or less. We explained our criteria forrepurchases in last year\u2019s report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. Weoriginally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, weincreased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value.\n19\n\nBut never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are\nmade above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningfulway by purchases up to our 120% limit.\nAnd that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The\nnumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends.", "brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The\nnumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends. Sobear with me.\nWe\u2019ll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. The\nbusiness earns 12% on tangible net worth \u2013 $240,000 \u2013 and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% onreinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of networth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million.\nYou would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our company\u2019s annual earnings and\nhave two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income andcapital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase thefuture earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one-third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8%each year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).\nAfter ten years our company would have a net worth of $4,317,850 (the original $2 million compounded at\n8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656(125% of our half of the company\u2019s net worth). And we would live happily ever after \u2013 with dividends and thevalue of our stock continuing to grow at 8% annually.\nThere is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we\nwould leave allearnings in the company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be sold\nat 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would growannually.", "company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be sold\nat 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would growannually. Call this option the \u201csell-off\u201d approach.\nUnder this \u201csell-off\u201d scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years\n($2 million compounded at 12%). Because we would be selling shares each year, our percentage ownership would\nhave declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the networth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable toeach of us can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the market value of your remaining shares would be $2,804,425, about4% greater than the value of your shares if we had followed the dividend approach.\nMoreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you\nwould have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! \u2013 you would have both more cash to spend annually and\nmore capital value.\nThis calculation, of course, assumes that our hypothetical company can earn an average of 12% annually on\nnet worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, theS&P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth.Both assumptions also seem reasonable for Berkshire, though certainly not assured.\nMoreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the\nargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger.", ", though certainly not assured.\nMoreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the\nargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshire\u2019s history \u2013 admittedly one that won\u2019t comeclose to being repeated \u2013 the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramatically superior to\nthe dividend policy.\nAside from the favorable math, there are two further \u2013 and important \u2013 arguments for a sell-off policy.\nFirst, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, thosewho wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. Itis safe to say, however, that a great many of them \u2013 perhaps even most of them \u2013 are in a net-savings mode andlogically should prefer no payment at all.\n20\n\nThe sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receipts\nand capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholderselect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use hisdividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also paya 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take placeat 125% of book value.)\nThe second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior \u2013 usually farinferior \u2013 to those under the sell-off program.", "The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior \u2013 usually farinferior \u2013 to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend\nprogram, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax ononly the gain portion of the cash receipts.\nLet me end this math exercise \u2013 and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill \u2013 by using my\nown case to illustrate how a shareholder\u2019s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased\ninvestment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 4\n1\u20444%o fm yB e r k s h i r e\nshares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) hasdecreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentage of the company has significantly decreased.\nYet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in\nBerkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figuresare $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have farmore money working for me\nat Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It\u2019s also true that my share ofboth Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value and the company\u2019s normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005.Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue \u2013 albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion \u2013 even as I nowannually give away more than 4\n1\u20442% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I\u2019ve recently doubled my\nlifetime pledges to certain foundations).\n************\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\nconfuse owners and drive away would-be investors.", "me pledges to certain foundations).\n************\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\nconfuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of hisCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits , a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition\nofSecurity Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a\nrestaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can\u2019t switchcapriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.\nMost companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very\nreluctantly. Our \u201cBig Four\u201d portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certaincases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.\nWe applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and\nwe love repurchases at appropriate prices.\nAt Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible\nand that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policyas long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable.If the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 4that the CenturyLink Center.

The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)\nLast year we had a second panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. All were insurance specialists,\nand shareholders subsequently indicated they wanted a little more variety. Therefore, this year we will have oneinsurance analyst, Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb will join theanalyst panel to ask questions that deal with our non-insurance operations.\nFinally \u2013 to spice things up \u2013 we would like to add to the panel a credentialed bear on Berkshire, preferably\none who is short the stock.

The three analysts will bring theirown Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the marketclose on a Friday and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutionalinvestors or analysts. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that will further educateshareholders about their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least 54questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is some extratime, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will takeplace at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 11 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers.

After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stockincreased by 18.2%. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grownfrom $19 to $134,973, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\nOn the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change in\nBerkshire\u2019s per-share book value versus the market performance of the S&P 500. What counts, of course, is per-share intrinsic value. But that\u2019s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (An\nextended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108.Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders toread them.)\nAs I\u2019ve long told you, Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference has\nwidened considerably in recent years. That\u2019s why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at 120%of book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic valueexceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however,because the stock price did not descend to the 120% level. If it does, we will be aggressive.\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire\u2019s book value and\nintrinsic value will outperform the S&P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fallshort, though, in years when the market is strong \u2013 as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49years, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S&P gain exceeded 15%.\nOver the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through full\ncycles in future years, we expect to do that again.", "tfalls occurring when the S&P gain exceeded 15%.\nOver the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through full\ncycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, youcould always own an index fund and be assured of S&P results.\nThe Year at Berkshire\nOn the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year \u2013 in certain cases very well.\nLet me count the ways:\n\u0160We completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and amajor interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.\nWith the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire in\nfuture acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, JorgePaulo Lemann. His talented associates \u2013 Bernardo Hees, Heinz\u2019s new CEO, and Alex Behring, itsChairman \u2013 are responsible for operations.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500thof those shown for A.\n3\n\nBerkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock that\ncarries a 9% coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred\u2019s annual return to12% or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $4.25 billion.\nThough the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a \u201cprivate equity\u201d transaction, there is a crucial\ndifference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times.", "e company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that itwould be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at anequity valuation appropriate to the time).\nOur partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minor\nearnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time chargesincurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014will be substantial.\nWith Heinz, Berkshire now owns 8\n1\u20442companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in the\nFortune 500. Only 4911\u20442to go.\nNV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity\nto about 88% of Nevada\u2019s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utilityoperation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will notbe\nMidAmerican\u2019s last major acquisition.\n\u0160MidAmerican is one of our \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d \u2013 a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, inaggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The othercompanies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution.", "thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfiesour goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-share results.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five toimprove also \u2013 perhaps by $1 billion or so pre-tax.\n\u0160Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9billion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 \u2013 that makes 11years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float \u2013 money that doesn\u2019t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion.Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million .\nWe now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurerBerkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICOin 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recentlypassed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service.

These transactionsranged from $1.9 million to $1.1 billion in size.\nCharlie and I encourage these deals.", "itions.\nLast year, we contracted for 25 of these, scheduled to cost $3.1 billion in aggregate. These transactionsranged from $1.9 million to $1.1 billion in size.\nCharlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses\nand that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and moreearnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will bemeaningful.\n\u0160Last year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in twowonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case \u2013 Marmon \u2013 our purchases brought us to the100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance \u2013 Iscar \u2013 the Wertheimer familyelected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we boughtcontrol in 2006.\nThese purchases added about $300 million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $800\nmillion of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year\u2019s letterrequired that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process thatreduced Berkshire\u2019s book value. (The charge was made to \u201ccapital in excess of par value\u201d; figure thatone\nout.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire\u2019s excess of intrinsicvalue over book value by the same $1.8 billion.\n\u0160Our subsidiaries spent a record $11 billion on plant and equipment during 2013, roughly twice ourdepreciation charge. About 89% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we invest abroad aswell, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.\n\u0160In a year in which most equity managers found it impossible to outperform the S&P 500, both ToddCombs and Ted Weschler handily did so.

Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s yearend employment \u2013 counting Heinz \u2013 totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year.The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don\u2019t panic: Theheadquarters gang still fits comfortably on one floor.)\n\u0160Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasingour ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stockrepurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if youthink tenths of a percent aren\u2019t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, eachincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire\u2019s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.\n5\n\nThe four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented.", "heir equity raises Berkshire\u2019s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.\n5\n\nThe four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the Hopediamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nGoing by our yearend holdings, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2013 earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. In\nthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.4 billion lastyear. But make no mistake: The $3 billion of their earnings we don\u2019t report is every bit as valuable to us asthe portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move\nthat enhances our share of future earnings \u2013 as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turnout to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees willgrow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important,our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion atyearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: \u201cThe advantage of being bi-sexual is that itdoubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.\u201d Similarly, our appetite for either operating businesses\nor passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire\u2019s history.", "hances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire\u2019s history. At the time, I called the transaction an \u201call-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.\u201d\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We\u2019ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too. Charlie and I have always considereda \u201cbet\u201d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 237 years by betting against America? If you compare our\ncountry\u2019s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. And the dynamismembedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. America\u2019s best days lie ahead.\nWith this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value by\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\nwill still be playing major roles in our economy. Insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses andindividuals \u2013 and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.\nMoreover, we will always maintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $20 billion of cash\nequivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations.", "s than Berkshire.\nMoreover, we will always maintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $20 billion of cash\nequivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations. As we view these and other strengths,Charlie and I like your company\u2019s prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\n6\n\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid outthe three elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to\n$129,253 and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 12.8% to $9,116per share.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and our\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-yearperiod has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains inboth sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders.", "g them all under one roof). Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\u2019t get any ideas!)\nInsurance\n\u201cOur investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a more\ndiversified base of earning power.\u201d\n\u2014 1967 Annual Report\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled our\nexpansion since that 1967 report was published.\nProperty-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\nas those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims comeand go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322013 77,240\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\u2019s float will almost certainly grow.\nIn National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate\ndemands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources.", "l \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate\ndemands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurancediffers in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)\n7\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latestyear for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry \u2013 despite the float income all companies enjoy \u2013 will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns as compared to other businesses.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eleven\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers who\nknow that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it.", "r float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims \u2013some $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 \u2013 and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each daywrite new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless andlong-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting\nliability.\nA counterpart to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on\nits true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwillasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar\nquality to that we have \u2013 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason \u2013 a\nhuge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain.", "plined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record asignificant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash,looking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers andreinsurers would meanwhile be far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $37 billion and a large\ncumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit\u2019s mind is an ideafactory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.\n8\n\nOne venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d).\nThis initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurancebrokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer canmatch the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising many years in the futurewill be paid promptly and fully.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld.", "ntees that legitimate claims arising many years in the futurewill be paid promptly and fully.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld.

BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that willgenerate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annualmeeting.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit afterboth prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We areparticularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistentlyand profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that\ncaused commentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake.", "any in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that\ncaused commentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone.General Re is now a gem.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 52 years of service in 2013. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. That operational efficiency continuestoday and is an all-important asset. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The\ninsurance needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 and onlya low-cost operation can\ndeliver these.\nGEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. Its low costs create a moat \u2013 an enduring one \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. Meanwhile, our little\ngecko continues to tell Americans how GEICO can save them important money. With our latest reduction inoperating costs, his story has become even more compelling.\n9\n\nIn 1995, we purchased the half of GEICO that we didn\u2019t already own, paying $1.4 billion more than the net\ntangible assets we acquired. That\u2019s \u201cgoodwill,\u201d and it will forever remain unchanged on our books. As GEICO\u2019sbusiness grows, however, so does its trueeconomic goodwill. I believe that figure to be approaching $20 billion.\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world.

The \u201ccustomer\u201d pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future if certain events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay \u2013 even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives \u2013 is all-important.\nBerkshire\u2019s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world\u2019s largest\nand most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to \u201ccede\u201d their liabilitiesto a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however \u2013 one that down the road proved to be financially strapped ora bad actor \u2013 would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.\nAlmost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest such\ntransaction ever recorded, Lloyd\u2019s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising frompolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materializein the future.", "in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising frompolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materializein the future.

What is certain,\nhowever, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $15 billion limit of our policy. No other insurer\u2019spromise would have given Lloyd\u2019s the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entitythen handling Lloyd\u2019s claims said it best: \u201cNames [the original insurers at Lloyd\u2019s] wanted to sleep easy at night,and we think we\u2019ve just bought them the world\u2019s best mattress.\u201d\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing wide\nmoats form something unique in the insurance world. The combination is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholdersthat will only get more valuable with time.\n10\n\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\n\u201cThough there are many regulatory restraints in the utility industry, it\u2019s possible that we will make\nadditional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts involved could be large.\u201d\n\u2014 1999 Annual Report\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristics\ndistinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter andsplit out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements.", "debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage was 9:1. (Our definition of coverage ispre-tax earnings/interest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under all\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companiesexclusively offering an essential service. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Now, with the acquisition ofNV Energy, MidAmerican\u2019s earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented byBerkshire\u2019s ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost ofdebt. This advantage benefits both us andour customers.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n\u0160BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy\u2019s circulatory system. Its hold on thenumber-one position strengthened in 2013.\nBNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n\u0160MidAmerican\u2019s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretchesfurther.", "lon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n\u0160MidAmerican\u2019s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretchesfurther. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: From a standing start nine years ago, MidAmericannow accounts for 7% of the country\u2019s wind generation capacity, with more on the way. Our share insolar \u2013 most of which is still in construction \u2013 is even larger.\nMidAmerican can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. Here\u2019s a little known fact:\nLast year MidAmerican retained more dollars of earnings \u2013 by far \u2013 than any other American electricutility. We and our regulators see this as an important advantage \u2013 one almost certain to exist five, ten andtwenty years from now.\nWhen our current projects are completed, MidAmerican\u2019s renewables portfolio will have cost $15 billion.\nWe relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns. And, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.\n11\n\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is meanwhile in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\nTangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfaction\ncovering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities.", "ople they represent.\nTangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfaction\ncovering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities. Our MidAmerican group ranked numberone, with 95.3% of respondents giving us a \u201cvery satisfied\u201d vote and not a single customer rating us \u201cdissatisfied.\u201dThe bottom score in the survey, incidentally, was a dismal 34.5%.\nAll three of our companies were ranked far lower by this measure before they were acquired by\nMidAmerican. The extraordinary customer satisfaction we have achieved is of great importance as we expand:Regulators in states we hope to enter are glad to see us, knowing we will be responsible operators.\nOur railroad has been diligent as well in anticipating the needs of its customers. Whatever you may have\nheard about our country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America\u2019s railsystem has never been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however,resting: BNSF spent $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, double its depreciation charge and a single-year record foranyrailroad. And, we will spend considerably more in 2014. Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need for\ndependable transportation, we know it\u2019s our job to plan ahead.\nLeading our two capital-intensive companies are Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, and the team of Matt Rose\nand Carl Ice at BNSF.

We present the data in this manner because Charlieand I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businessesaggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.\n13\n\nI won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. Withsoftware, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as theamortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realcosts. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenseswhen earnings are calculated \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpoint they could not be more different.\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $648 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses.

We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not.This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made.

But this usually takes 15 years and \u2013 alas \u2013 it will be my successor whose reported earnings get thebenefit of their expiration.\nEvery dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost.

Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector.

But I\u2019ve now worked 30 years with the marvelous Blumkin family,and I\u2019m excited about the remarkable store \u2013 truly Texas-sized \u2013 it is building at The Colony, in the northern part ofthe Dallas metropolitan area.\nWhen the store is completed next year, NFM will have \u2013 under one roof, and on a 433-acre site \u2013 1.8 million\nsquare feet of retail and supporting warehouse space.

(It\u2019s reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted my\noffer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers orlawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company\u2019s financial statements wereunaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.\nMrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 \u2013 definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM\u2019s\nfinancial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $72,264 of networth and $50 \u2013 nozeros omitted \u2013 of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B,\nher son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.\nThe punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school.

In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fifth largest equity investment and one we value highly.\nIn addition to our equity holdings, we also invest substantial sums in bonds.

I will talk more about Ben a bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let mefirst tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though neither changed my net worth bymuch, they are instructive.\nThis tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices,\ncaused by a widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small ruralbanks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated both leveraged farmers andtheir lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble\u2019s aftermath than in our recentGreat Recession.\nIn 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me\n$280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothingabout operating a farm.", "rm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me\n$280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothingabout operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many bushels of cornand soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, Icalculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that productivitywould improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.\nI needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and\npotentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop and prices would sometimesdisappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under anypressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or morewhat I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.\n17\n\nIn 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon\u2019s landlord when I was the\ncompany\u2019s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. wasselling. Again, a bubble had popped \u2013 this one involving commercial real estate \u2013 and the RTC had been created todispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.\nHere, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield from\nthe property was about 10%. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increasewhen several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant \u2013 who occupied around 20% of theproject\u2019s space \u2013 was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70.", "several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant \u2013 who occupied around 20% of theproject\u2019s space \u2013 was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of thisbargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property\u2019s location was alsosuperb: NYU wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\nI joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was an\nexperienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it theydid. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equityinvestment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed severalspecial distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I\u2019ve yet to view the property.\nIncome from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in the decades to come. Though\nthe gains won\u2019t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and,subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.\nI tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:\n\u0160You don\u2019t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren\u2019t, you\nmust recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simpleand don\u2019t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick \u201cno.\u201d\n\u0160Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable making a roughestimate of the asset\u2019s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate everyinvestment possibility.", "t you are considering. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable making a roughestimate of the asset\u2019s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate everyinvestment possibility. But omniscience isn\u2019t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.\n\u0160If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating.There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and Iam skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their firsttoss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that\na given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.\n\u0160With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all\nabout their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field \u2013 not by thosewhose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stockprices, give it a try on weekdays.\n\u0160Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time.Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hearTV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle\u2019sscathing comment: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.\u201d)\n18\n\n\u0160My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market\nmight do in the years immediately following \u2013 1987 and 1994 \u2013 was of no importance to me in makingthose investments. I can\u2019t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time.", "ock market\nmight do in the years immediately following \u2013 1987 and 1994 \u2013 was of no importance to me in makingthose investments. I can\u2019t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever thechatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.\nThere is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks\nprovide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farmor the New York real estate.\nIt should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations\nplaced on their holdings \u2013 and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering myproperty yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his \u2013 and those pricesvaried widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state \u2013 how in the world could I be other thanbenefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I wouldbuy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\nOwners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners\ncause them to behave irrationally as well.", "could either sell to him or just go on farming.\nOwners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners\ncause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interestrates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits \u2013 and, worse yet,important to consider acting upon their comments.\nThose people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often become\nfrenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering animplied message of \u201cDon\u2019t just sit there, dosomething.\u201d For these investors, liquidity is transformed from the\nunqualified benefit it should be to a curse.\nA \u201cflash crash\u201d or some other extreme market fluctuation can\u2019t hurt an investor any more than an erratic\nand mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor ifhe has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a\neuphoric world is your enemy.\nDuring the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling my\nfarm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of asolid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. Sowhy would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of themmight eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth wasgoing to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?\n************\nWhen Charlie and I buy stocks \u2013 which we think of as small portions of businesses \u2013 our analysis is very\nsimilar to that which we use in buying entire businesses.", "ty existing in America?\n************\nWhen Charlie and I buy stocks \u2013 which we think of as small portions of businesses \u2013 our analysis is very\nsimilar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimatean earnings range for five years out, or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at areasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimatefuture earnings \u2013 which is usually the case \u2013 we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have workedtogether, we have never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views\nof other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.\nIt\u2019s vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our \u201ccircle of competence\u201d and stay well inside of\nit. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters thatoccur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and adesire to be where the action is.\n19\n\nMost investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise,\nthey will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.\nI have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn\u2019t need this skill. In aggregate,\nAmerican business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, inunpredictable fits and starts). In the 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497,\npaying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21stCentury will witness further gains, almost certain to be\nsubstantial.", "he 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497,\npaying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21stCentury will witness further gains, almost certain to be\nsubstantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners \u2013 neither he nor his \u201chelpers\u201d can dothat \u2013 but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-costS&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.\nThat\u2019s the \u201cwhat\u201d of investing for the non-professional. The \u201cwhen\u201d is also important. The main danger is\nthat the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then becomedisillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs\u2019 observation: \u201cA bull market is like sex. Itfeels best just before it ends.\u201d) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over along period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the\u201cknow-nothing\u201d investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory\nresults. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.\nIf \u201cinvestors\u201d frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of their\ncrops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earningsrealized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice andswitched properties.\nNevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profit\nfrom giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors inaggregate, devoid of benefit.", "s will constantly be urged to be active by those who profit\nfrom giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors inaggregate, devoid of benefit. So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in afarm.\nMy money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain\ninstructions I\u2019ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife\u2019sbenefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because allof my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to\ncertain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trusteecould not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard\u2019s.) I believe the trust\u2019s long-term results from this policy will be superior tothose attained by most investors \u2013 whether pension funds, institutions or individuals \u2013 who employ high-feemanagers.\n************\nAnd now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben\u2019s\nbook The Intelligent Investor , which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.\nBefore reading Ben\u2019s book, I had wandered around the investing landscape, devouring everything written\non the subject. Much of what I read fascinated me: I tried my hand at charting and at using market indicia to predictstock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of thiswas fun, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere.\nIn contrast, Ben\u2019s ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek\nletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and20.", "as were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek\nletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.\n20\n\nA couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing an\nunnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the firstedition and \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities ofGEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire\u2019s would have been far different.\nThe 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $17 and earning\nabout $10 per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leavinghimself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time thatrequired the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.\nThe recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlington\nand Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fullyowned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $40 million. Now itssuccessor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earns that amount every four days.\nI can\u2019t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor . Whatever the cost, it would\nunderscore the truth of Ben\u2019s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get.", "our days.\nI can\u2019t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor .

Of all the investments I evermade, buying Ben\u2019s book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses).\n************\nLocal and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensions\nthey couldn\u2019t afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm thatwas born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pensionmathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.\nInvestment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to\nKatharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and theimportance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.\nDuring the next decade, you will read a lot of news \u2013 badnews \u2013 about public pension plans. I hope my\nmemo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.\nThe Annual Meeting\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3\nrdat the CenturyLink Center.

We know the journalists\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is someextra time, we will take more from the audience.

Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered inketchup, of course) for lunch.

For this Golden Anniversary,\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50years and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what theother had written. Warren\u2019s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie\u2019s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly newones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*\nDuring our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change in\nBerkshire\u2019s per-share book value. We\u2019ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\nIn our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\nnow.", "but useful, tracking device\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\nIn our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\nnow. That was true because Berkshire\u2019s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restatedto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of bookvalue were \u201cmarked to market.\u201d\nToday, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these\nare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how\nmuch the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and itsbook value has materially widened.\nWith that in mind, we have added a new set of data \u2013 the historical record of Berkshire\u2019s stock price \u2013 to\nthe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.Monthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairmanand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire\u2019s per-shareintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company\u2019sshares.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one.", "sed in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:\n\u2039Our \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d \u2013 a collection of Berkshire\u2019s largest non-insurance businesses \u2013 had a record $12.4\nbillion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group areBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I\u2019ve called it Iscar in the past),Lubrizol and Marmon.\nOf the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.\nSubsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire bythe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies ourgoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve\nas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that havealready closed or are under contract.\n\u2039Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During theyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures canbadly hurt their businesses.\nBNSF is, by far, Berkshire\u2019s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we\nwill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015.", "failures canbadly hurt their businesses.\nBNSF is, by far, Berkshire\u2019s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we\nwill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroadhas spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings ordepreciation charges.\nThough weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating\nproblems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That\ncan\u2019t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disruptsoperations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to showresults. During the last three months, BNSF\u2019s performance metrics have materially improved from lastyear\u2019s figures.\n\u2039Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have twocompanies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250million and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection ofbusinesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 \u2013 thatmakes 12 years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float \u2013 money thatdoesn\u2019t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $84billion.", "in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float \u2013 money thatdoesn\u2019t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $84billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\u2019s earnings, floatgenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.\n* Throughout this letter, as well as in the \u201cGolden Anniversary\u201d letters included later in this report, all earnings are\nstated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\n4\n\nMeanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billion\nearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million .\n\u2039While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on\nacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, thelargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed underMarmon\u2019s jurisdiction.\nCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren\u2019t.) They deploy\ncapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expertmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularlyappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.\n\u2039Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in theacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnershipwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint.", "join his 3G Capital group in theacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnershipwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint.

They hold themselves to extraordinarily highperformance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.\nWe expect to partner with 3G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financing\nrole, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement,however, will usually be to link up as a permanent equity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the\nfinancing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.\nBerkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or with\nother partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will belimited to friendly transactions.\n\u2039In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that isexceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company\u2019s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decidedthat if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recentlycompleted, and we are now \u201ccar guys.\u201d\nLarry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partners\nof all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl isnow the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that areoutstanding.\nIn recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue.", "h-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that areoutstanding.\nIn recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. There\nare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by therelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire\u2019s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers towelcome further purchases by us. If we do this \u2013 and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices \u2013 we willbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl\u2019s $9 billion of sales.\nWith the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 9\n1\u20442companies that would be listed on the Fortune\n500 were they independent (Heinz is the1\u20442). That leaves 4901\u20442fish in the sea. Our lines are out.\n5\n\n\u2039Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice their\ndepreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will alwaysinvest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have beenuncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born inthe United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has givenus.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s yearend employees \u2013 including those at Heinz \u2013 totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from lastyear. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sensegoing crazy.\n\u2039Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo.

Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, AmericanExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership ofWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren\u2019t important, ponder thismath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raisesBerkshire\u2019s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the HopeDiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nIf Berkshire\u2019s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2014 earnings\nbefore discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.6 billion lastyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion ofthese companies\u2019 earnings we don\u2019t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move that\nenhances Berkshire\u2019s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retainedearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar).", "us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gainsmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capitalgains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)\nOur flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding\nsensible uses for Berkshire\u2019s endless gusher of cash.\n\u2039I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investmentexperience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other.And some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed\u2019s wonderful book, Where\nAre the Customers\u2019 Yachts? , a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a\ncaption says, \u201cThere are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words orpictures.\u201d If you haven\u2019t read Schwed\u2019s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor aretruly priceless.)\n6\n\nAmong Arno\u2019s \u201ccertain things,\u201d I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and the\nmanagement of businesses. I therefore think it\u2019s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our twoinvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics.", "sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.\nI\u2019ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the very\nlimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of workand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to sayamong the best).\n************\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\nBerkshire\u2019s history. At the time, I called the transaction an \u201call-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.\u201d\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We\u2019ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a\u201cbet\u201d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting against America? If you compare our\ncountry\u2019s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real\nper-capita U.S. output has sextupled . My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.\nThough the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America\u2019s problems, I\u2019ve never seen one who wishes toemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).\nThe dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won\u2019t come in a\nsmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government.", "The dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won\u2019t come in a\nsmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, mostassuredly, America\u2019s best days lie ahead.\nWith this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value by\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway\nEnergy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of mostfamilies. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and Isee a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019s intrinsicvalue.", "for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019s intrinsicvalue. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to\n$140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 pershare.\n7\n\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and our\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in bothsectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That\u2019s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66and Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquireDuracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\u2019t get any ideas!)\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has\npropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million.", "e\u2019s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has\npropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution wassimplicity itself.\nJack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to my\noffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack\u2019s companies had ever had anaudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn\u2019t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also abit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.\nOn pages 128-129, we reproduce the 1\n1\u20442-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction.\nThat contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire\u2019s best deal: NationalIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds thatof any other insurer in the world.\nOne reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C\ninsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certainworkers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount offloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322014 83,921\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve.", "ur float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322014 83,921\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercial\ninsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, isparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, itwill be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that\nwe can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strength\nis a key pillar in Berkshire\u2019s economic fortress.\n8\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of lowinterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profitproblems of the industry.\nAs noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years.", "ed at an underwriting profit for\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers,\nwho know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message isgiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount\nof our float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think\nof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claimsand related expenses \u2013 a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 \u2013 and that reduces float. Justas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing\non its true value.", "e. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing\non its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any\ngoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it \u2013 to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with\nwhich we agree) this excess value will never be entered on our books. But I can assure you that it\u2019s real. That\u2019s one\nreason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings.", "s from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a marketthat might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if notfacing insolvency.\nAjit\u2019s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking\nfor more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of BerkshireHathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantlywelcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we hadwritten only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\nworld. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines ofinsurance. We repeat last year\u2019s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generatevolume in the billions within a few years.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth.", "hprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused\ncommentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because it deserved to succeed. No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes\nto drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 andonly a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by\ninsuring with GEICO.", "r expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 andonly a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by\ninsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.\n10\n\nGEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. (We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) Thecompany\u2019s low costs create a moat \u2013 an enduring one \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires\nof telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularlyendearing quality \u2013 he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from hisfame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.\n************\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion fromunderwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies andtheir managers.\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2014 2013 2014 2013\nBH Reinsurance .................................... $ 6 0 6 $1,294 $42,454 $37,231\nGeneral Re ......................................... 2 7 7 2 8 3 19,280 20,013\nGEICO ............................................ 1,159 1,127 13,569 12,566\nOther Primary ...................................... 6 2 6 3 8 5 8,618 7,430\n$2,668 $3,089 $83,921 $77,240\n************\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises.", "...... 1,159 1,127 13,569 12,566\nOther Primary ...................................... 6 2 6 3 8 5 8,618 7,430\n$2,668 $3,089 $83,921 $77,240\n************\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The \u201ccustomer\u201d pays money now; the insurer promises to\npay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives, is all-important.\nBerkshire\u2019s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world\u2019s largest and\nmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.That is, these insurers wished to \u201ccede\u201d these liabilities \u2013 most of them potential losses from asbestos claims \u2013 to areinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hookfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatensthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.\nLast year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billion\nsingle premium. I believe that the policy\u2019s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd\u2019s, inwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.\nIn fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion.

When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this typewill be made, Berkshire has been the party \u2013 the only party \u2013 to call.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by\nwide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.\n11\n\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d), that share important\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage was more than 8:1.

This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage ofbeing owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.This economic fact benefits both us andour customers.\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n\u0081 BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy\u2019s circulatory system.\nBNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n\u0081 BHE\u2019s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. In\naddition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% ofthe country\u2019s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses,BHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country\u2019s natural gas consumption; the recently-purchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. andPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout theworld for decades to come.\nBHE can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings.", "dPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout theworld for decades to come.\nBHE can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. In fact, last year the company\nretained more dollars of earnings \u2013 by far \u2013 than any other American electric utility. We and ourregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage \u2013 one almost certain to distinguishBHE from other utilities for many years to come.\nWhen BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company\u2019s renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.\n12\n\nLast year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our rates\nremain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.\nThe story at BNSF, however \u2013 as I noted earlier \u2013 was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad\ndisappointed many of its customers.", "record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.\nThe story at BNSF, however \u2013 as I noted earlier \u2013 was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad\ndisappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF hasmade in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.\nThe two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably more\nfreight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific\u2019s last year, andwe lost market share as a result. Moreover, U.P.\u2019s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot ofwork to do.\nWe are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving our\nrailroad\u2019s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as theindustry\u2019s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentagecompares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.\u2019s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our hugeinvestments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits shouldfollow.\nHere are the key figures for Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF:\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2014 2013 2012\nU.K. utilities ................................................................ $ 5 2 7 $ 3 6 2 $ 4 2 9\nIowa utility ................................................................. 2 9 8 2 3 0 2 3 6\nNevada utilities ............................................................. 5 4 9 \u2014 \u2014\nPacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah) ..................................... 1,010 982 737\nGas Pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ............................ 3 7 9 3 8 5 3 8 3\nHomeServices ..............................................................", ".............. 1,010 982 737\nGas Pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ............................ 3 7 9 3 8 5 3 8 3\nHomeServices .............................................................. 1 3 9 1 3 9 8 2\nOther (net) .................................................................. 2 3 6 4 9 1\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ....................... 3,138 2,102 1,958\nInterest ..................................................................... 4 2 7 2 9 6 3 1 4\nIncome taxes ................................................................ 6 1 6 1 7 0 1 7 2\nNet earnings ................................................................ $ 2,095 $ 1,636 $ 1,472\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ............................................ $ 1,882 $ 1,470 $ 1,323\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2014 2013 2012\nRevenues ................................................................... $23,239 $22,014 $20,835\nOperating expenses ......................................................... 16,237 15,357 14,835\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes ................................. 7,002 6,657 6,000\nInterest (net) ................................................................ 8 3 3 7 2 9 6 2 3\nIncome taxes ................................................................ 2,300 2,135 2,005\nNet earnings ................................................................ $ 3,869 $ 3,793 $ 3,372\n13\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

In contrast, the operating expense\nfigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certainintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers moreaccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAPfigures.\nI won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understand\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For\nsoftware, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges againstother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accountingrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpointthey could not be more different.\n14\n\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not. The \u201cnon-real\u201d charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\nThe GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have\n$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even iftrue earnings are flat.\nDepreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report\nis a real cost.", "f. When that happens, reported earnings increase even iftrue earnings are flat.\nDepreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report\nis a real cost. That\u2019s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wirethem up for a polygraph test.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\n************\nTo get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging from\nlollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector\u2019s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets,\nenjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate goodreturns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes Imade in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economicdynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.\nFortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\nof $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and usinglittle leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill.", "investment if it is bought for too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed inthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a goodmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value inboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors \u2013 both current and potential \u2013 read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required.

We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? Atone time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of thecompany\u2019s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gainmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon\u2019s leasing operations under this heading.", "perations in one place.

(The figuresfor the many dozens of Marmon\u2019s other businesses remain in the previous section.)\nOur other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers).\nThese companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy hasgained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors,and that\u2019s paying off.\nKevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest home\nbuilder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought byAmericans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.\nKey to Clayton\u2019s earnings is the company\u2019s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of\n2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire\u2019sbacking. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors\u2019 retail sales as well as our own.\nMany of Clayton\u2019s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company\u2019s\nsensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of ourborrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than theirhigher-income brethren.\nAt Marmon\u2019s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. The\nnature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improvedpricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong.", "ture of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improvedpricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleetconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.\nOne further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we\nmanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book anyprofit when we transfer\ncars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a\u201cbargain\u201d price. The difference between that figure and a \u201cretail\u201d price is only slowly reflected in our earningsthrough smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact aswell as others, Marmon\u2019s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on ourbooks.\nHere\u2019s the earnings recap for this sector:\n2014\n2013 2012\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share) ............. $ 1 2 2 $ 8 0 $ 3 5\nClayton ............................... 5 5 8 4 1 6 2 5 5\nCORT ................................ 3 6 4 0 4 2\nMarmon \u2013 Containers and Cranes ..... 2 3 8 2 2 6 2 4 6\nMarmon \u2013 Railcars .................... 4 4 2 3 5 3 2 9 9\nXTRA ................................ 1 4 7 1 2 5 1 0 6\nNet financial income* ................. 2 9 6 3 2 4 4 1 0\n$ 1,839 $ 1,564 $ 1,393\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n16\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.\n12/31/14\nShares** CompanyPercentage of\nCompany\nOwnedCost* Market\n(in millions)\n151,610,700 American Express Company ................. 14.8 $ 1,287 $ 14,106\n400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company .................... 9 . 2 1,299 16,888\n18,513,482 DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. ............. 8 . 6 8 4 3 1,402\n15,430,586 Deere & Company .......................... 4 .", ",000 The Coca-Cola Company .................... 9 . 2 1,299 16,888\n18,513,482 DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. ............. 8 . 6 8 4 3 1,402\n15,430,586 Deere & Company .......................... 4 . 5 1,253 1,365\n24,617,939 DIRECTV .................................. 4 . 9 1,454 2,134\n13,062,594 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ............. 3 . 0 7 5 0 2,532\n76,971,817 International Business Machines Corp. ...... 7 . 8 13,157 12,349\n24,669,778 Moody\u2019s Corporation ........................ 12.1 248 2,364\n20,060,390 Munich Re .................................. 11.8 2,990 4,023\n52,477,678 The Procter & Gamble Company ............ 1 . 9 3 3 6 4,683 ***\n22,169,930 Sanofi ....................................... 1 . 7 1,721 2,032\n96,890,665 U.S. Bancorp ................................ 5 . 4 3,033 4,355\n43,387,980 USG Corporation ............................ 30.0 836 1,214\n67,707,544 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ....................... 2 . 1 3,798 5,815\n483,470,853 Wells Fargo & Company .................... 9 . 4 11,871 26,504\nOthers ....................................... 10,180 15,704\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .... $55,056 $ 117,470\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \u201ccost\u201d differs in a few cases because of write-ups or\nwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.\n**Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.***Held under contract of sale for this amount.\nBerkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares\nof Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion.

An attentive investor , I\u2019m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier. I\nmade a big mistake with this investment by dawdling.\nAt the end of 2012 we owned 415 million shares of Tesco, then and now the leading food retailer in the\nU.K. and an important grocer in other countries as well. Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and themarket value was a similar amount.\n17\n\nIn 2013, I soured somewhat on the company\u2019s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a\nprofit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior\u201cthumb-sucking.\u201d (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)\nDuring 2014, Tesco\u2019s problems worsened by the month. The company\u2019s market share fell, its margins\ncontracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see acockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.\nWe sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we should\nmention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444million, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investmentloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses.", "on, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investmentloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these lossesoccurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed tobe even cheaper.\n************\nOur investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&P 500\nrose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2.\nConcurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes$1 to buy what could be bought for 13\u00a2 in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).\nThere is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars.\nThink back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as \u201cthe transfer to others of purchasing powernow with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power \u2013 after taxes have been paid on nominal\ngains \u2013 in the future.\u201d\nThe unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far\nsafer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities \u2013 Treasuries, forexample \u2013 whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, aperiod including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree oranother it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.\nStock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term , however,\ncurrency-denominated instruments are riskier investments \u2013 farriskier investments \u2013 than widely-diversified stock\nportfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions.", "truments are riskier investments \u2013 farriskier investments \u2013 than widely-diversified stock\nportfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. Thatlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy forrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is farfrom\nsynonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.\nIt is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and\npurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors \u2013 say,investment banks \u2013 whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sellsecurities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for fundsshould keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.\nFor the great majority of investors, however, who can \u2013 and should \u2013 invest with a multi-decade horizon,\nquotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasingpower over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time , will prove far less\nrisky than dollar-based securities.\n18\n\nIf the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may,\nironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned fallingstock prices and advised investing in \u201csafe\u201d Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded thissermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement.", "d investing in \u201csafe\u201d Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded thissermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (TheS&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, theseinvestors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fundwhose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups anddowns, to be sure).\nInvestors, of course, can, by their own behavior , make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active\ntrading, attempts to \u201ctime\u201d market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary feesto managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner ofequities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has noplace in the investor\u2019s tool kit: Anything can\nhappen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator \u2013 and definitely not Charlie nor I \u2013 can\ntell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.\nThe commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to \u201cthe little guy.\u201d Huge institutional\ninvestors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sitstight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn,recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool\u2019s game.\nThere are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good \u2013 though in the short run, it\u2019s difficult\nto determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent.

The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).I\u2019ll present a special prize to the 12-or-under contestant who makes the best toss. Deb Bosanek will be the judge.\nAt 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink\u2019s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlieand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale.

The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1\u20442hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\nsignificant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more.

The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains theexpert on\nbusiness and financial matters, and who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, atBerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\ninteresting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is asked.)\nWe will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire.

Our hope is that the analysts andjournalists will ask questions that add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\n21\n\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from eachanalyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from theaudience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annualmeeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, adrawing.\nWhile I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also haveadequate time to analyze it. That\u2019s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and whyour annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders.\n************\nWe get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses who\nwant you to enjoy yourselves. This year, because we expect record attendance, we have worried about a shortage ofhotel rooms.

That gets expensive. Those people on a tightbudget should check the Airbnb website.\n************\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\nStars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies.Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much tothem as their paycheck.\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federalincome tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\u2019s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019sactivities \u2013 and the list goes on and on.\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant.

I had expected the letter; I wassurprised by the price.\nBerkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership\nLtd. (\u201cBPL\u201d), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before thetender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and hesaid, \u201cFine, we have a deal.\u201d Then came Berkshire\u2019s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton\u2019sbehavior and didn\u2019t tender.\nThat was a monumentally stupid decision.Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it\noperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically.", "monumentally stupid decision.Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it\noperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unableto change course.\nThat was true even though the industry\u2019s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire\u2019s own\nBoard minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: \u201cThe textile industry in New England started going out ofbusiness forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply anddemand have been balanced.\u201d\nAbout a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing \u2013\nboth with roots in the 19\nthCentury \u2013 joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and\n10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managementsviewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following theconsolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.\nMeanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase\nshares. And that pattern caught my attention.\nI purchased BPL\u2019s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more\nrepurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 andbook value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puffremaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasurewas enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.\nBerkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set\nout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds.", "d, however, no more could be expected.\nBerkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set\nout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of ouroriginal purchases. There it was \u2013 my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for otherdiscarded butts.\nInstead, irritated by Stanton\u2019s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire\nshares.\n24\n\nBy April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board\nmeeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury\u2019s and my childish behavior \u2013 after all, whatwas an eighth of a point to either of us? \u2013 he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL\u2019s capitalinvested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.\nBecause of Berkshire\u2019s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had\nfallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by thetextile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire\u2019s 1964 annual reportis reproduced on pages 130-142.)\nFor a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet,\nits earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisenfrom the disastrous results in earlier years.\nThen the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the\ntextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness \u2013 stupidity? \u2013 has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation.\n************\nUndeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL\u2019s resources to a dying business, I quickly\ncompounded the error.", ". In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation.\n************\nUndeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL\u2019s resources to a dying business, I quickly\ncompounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the mostcostly in my career.\nEarly in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), a small but\npromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweetspot: I understood and liked the industry.\nJack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me \u2013 me, personally. In\nno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I\u2019vehad 48 years to think about that question, and I\u2019ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossalmistake.\nIf BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to\nform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impededfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequentacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by thelegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I optedto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decisionthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.\n************\nOne more confession and then I\u2019ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought\nWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a \u201cbargain\u201d based on theassets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire\u2019s existing textile business.", "aumbec Mills, another New England textile company?

Nevertheless \u2013 surprise,\nsurprise \u2013 Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.\nAnd now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if you\nhear that I\u2019ve been spotted wandering around New England.\n25\n\nCharlie Straightens Me Out\nMy cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of\nfree puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absoluteinvestment performance.\nEven then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a\n1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learnedthat GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gainsin those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. BenGraham had taught me that technique, and it worked.\nBut a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only\nto a point. With large sums, it would never work well.\nIn addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term\ninvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriagepartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating.", "tive as short-term\ninvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriagepartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been ahighly satisfactory \u201cdate\u201d: If we had taken Seabury Stanton\u2019s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL\u2019s weighted annualreturn on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)\n************\nIt took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could\ncombine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and asa youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather\u2019s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, longafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor whointroduced us predicted that we would hit it off \u2013 and we did.\nIf you\u2019ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious\nmemory, and some firm opinions. I\u2019m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don\u2019t agree. In 56 years,however, we\u2019ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: \u201cWarren,think it over and you\u2019ll agree with me because you\u2019re smart and I\u2019m right.\u201d\nWhat most of you do notknow about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began\nhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today \u2013 some 55 years later.", "hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today \u2013 some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can\u2019t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recentyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,is working on another major project.\nFrom my perspective, though, Charlie\u2019s most important architectural feat was the design of today\u2019s\nBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderfulprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.\n26\n\nAltering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without\nCharlie\u2019s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when \u2013 ahem \u2013 I\nhad attended three ). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his\nlogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie\u2019s blueprint. My role has been that of generalcontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.\nThe year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part \u2013\nremember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See\u2019s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.\nSee\u2019s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning\nabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a hugeasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significantpricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See\u2019s major gains in earnings over time.", "not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significantpricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See\u2019s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, thesewould materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See\u2019s could be expected togush cash for decades to come.\nThe family controlling See\u2019s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that\nmuch. But I didn\u2019t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn\u2019t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A pricethat was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrificpurchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.\nTo date, See\u2019s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only\n$40 million. See\u2019s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that,in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, throughwatching See\u2019s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes tomany other profitable investments.\n************\nEven with Charlie\u2019s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was\nDexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like acigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simplydidn\u2019t see that coming.\nConsequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP\naccounting, however, doesn\u2019t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshirestock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7billion.", "close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshirestock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nSeveral of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose\nearnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderfulbusiness \u2013 which Berkshire most certainly is \u2013 for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.\nWe\u2019ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares\nBerkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seemblind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater thanthe intrinsic value of the business you receive.\n27\n\nI\u2019ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for-\nstock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker\u2019s focus will be on describing \u201ccustomary\u201dpremiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions \u2013 an absolutely asinine way to evaluate theattractiveness of an acquisition \u2013 or whether the deal will increase the acquirer\u2019s earnings-per-share (which in itselfshould be far from determinative).", "ns \u2013 an absolutely asinine way to evaluate theattractiveness of an acquisition \u2013 or whether the deal will increase the acquirer\u2019s earnings-per-share (which in itselfshould be far from determinative).

Post mortems ofacquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms.They should instead be standard practice.\nI can promise you that long after I\u2019m gone, Berkshire\u2019s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic value\ncalculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can\u2019t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens(even if your advisor has handed you an expensive \u201cfairness\u201d opinion endorsing that swap).\n************\nOverall, Berkshire\u2019s acquisitions have worked out well \u2013 and very well in the case of a few large ones. So,\ntoo, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their marketprices so any gains \u2013 including those unrealized \u2013 are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses webuy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions ofdollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries have becomehuge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.\nListening to Charlie has paid off.\n28\n\nBerkshire Today\nBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.\nConglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly\ndeserve it.", "Today\nBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.\nConglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly\ndeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why theconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.\nSince I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the\nsilliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,promotion or dubious accounting \u2013 and often by all three \u2013 these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate\u2019s stockto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-sotimes earnings. They immediately applied \u201cpooling\u201d accounting to the acquisition, which \u2013 with not a dime\u2019s worthof change in the underlying businesses \u2013 automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof ofmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even theenhancement, of the acquirer\u2019s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure andthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.\nWall Street\u2019s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street\u2019s denizens are\nalways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willinglysprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates\u2019 accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how tofurther juice the numbers.", "hat generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willinglysprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates\u2019 accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how tofurther juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.\nSince the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, its\nCEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristicallymediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate\u2019scollection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was dealvelocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.\nThe resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, Litton\nIndustries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famousconglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, \u201cEvery Napoleon meets his Watergate.\u201d)\nBack then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts \u2013 many of them ridiculously transparent \u2013 were excused or\noverlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a hugeplus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how\nbad the operating realities of the business might become.\nIn the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his \u201cbold, imaginative\naccounting.\u201d Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found amanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.\n29\n\nEventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice.", "as having found amanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.\n29\n\nEventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, it\nbecame evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares \u2013 just like chain-lettermodels \u2013 most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodicallyblossom in our country \u2013 they are every promoter\u2019s dream \u2013 though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise.The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters,the sums hijacked can be staggering.\nAt both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That\nbehavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that isoverpriced and \u2013 all too often \u2013 outright dishonesty.\n************\nSo what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire\u2019s conglomerate structure? To put the case\nsimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capitalgrowth.\nOne of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets\nwill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all itsexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.\nNevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire\nminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed fordecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements.", "se 1954 Berkshire\nminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed fordecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning ourobsolete textile mills for far too long.\nA CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital into\nunrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes beadmitted. Moreover, it\u2019s unlikely thatCEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job\neven if he or she was inclined to undertake it.\nAt the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attempt\nto reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as theymove capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes thenclamor to be fed \u2013 among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocatorsas leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don\u2019t come cheap.\nIn contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at\nminimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will makemore. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.\nAt Berkshire, we can \u2013 without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs \u2013 move huge sums from\nbusinesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise.Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject topressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.", "oreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject topressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That\u2019s important: If horses hadcontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\n30\n\nAnother major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses \u2013 a.k.a. common\nstocks. That\u2019s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative hasproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offeredby the stock market every day \u2013 in small pieces, to be sure \u2013 are often far more attractive than the businesses we areconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we\u2019ve realized from marketable securities havehelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.\nIn effect, the world is Berkshire\u2019s oyster \u2013 a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those\nrealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we canevaluate. And that\u2019s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like tenyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has beenconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a farlarger size than the many businesses\nthat are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.\nI mentioned earlier that See\u2019s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital\nrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. Butour many attempts to do so were largely futile.", "arnings compared to its modest capital\nrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. Butour many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we haveused the excess funds generated by See\u2019s to help purchase other businesses. If See\u2019s had remained a stand-alonecompany, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavilydepleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs.\n************\nBerkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now the\nhome of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.\nFamilies that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, the\nbest decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understandswell. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)\nWhen one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makes\nsense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.\nThe first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing \u201csynergies\u201d from the\ncombining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller\u2019sassociates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however \u2013 and there areplenty of them \u2013 usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: \u201c She got\nthe goldmine, I got the shaft. \u201d\nThe second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer.", "f them \u2013 usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: \u201c She got\nthe goldmine, I got the shaft. \u201d\nThe second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately called\nthemselves \u201cleveraged buyout firms.\u201d When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s \u2013 remember RJR andBarbarians at the Gate ? \u2013 these buyers hastily relabeled themselves \u201cprivate-equity.\u201d\nThe name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reduced and debt is piled on in\nvirtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in partdetermined by the buyer assessing the maximum amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.\n31\n\nLater, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage\nwith new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharplydownward, sometimes even to a negative figure.\nIn truth, \u201cequity\u201d is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt\nis currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often toanother leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.\nBerkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the\ncompany\u2019s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyondthat, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealingwith banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.\nSome sellers don\u2019t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of\ncompetition.\n************\nSometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no\nsense.", "matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of\ncompetition.\n************\nSometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no\nsense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability tomove funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicatethemselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here\u2019s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominalcosts for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directorswould soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.\nFinally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. For\nexample, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate hugeamounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantageover most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.\nInvestment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50%\npremiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for\u201ccontrol value\u201d and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer\u2019s CEO takes charge. (Whatacquisition-hungry manager will challenge thatassertion?)\nA few years later, bankers \u2013 bearing straight faces \u2013 again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the\nearlier acquisition in order to \u201cunlock shareholder value.\u201d Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of itspurported \u201ccontrol value\u201d without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company willflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracyof the parent company.", "sating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company willflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracyof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)\nIf the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be\nurged by its bankers to pay a hefty \u201ccontrol\u201d premium for the privilege. (Mental \u201cflexibility\u201d of this sort by thebanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading tofees.)\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.\nBerkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divesta bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.\n32\n\nVoluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation\nflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now wouldhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantagesderived from Berkshire\u2019s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likelyincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.\n************\nBefore I depart the subject of spin-offs, let\u2019s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned\nearlier: LTV. I\u2019ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about JimmyLing that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine . Look it up on the Internet.\nThrough a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to\nnumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself.", "n the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had nopeer in that respect.\nLing\u2019s strategy, which he labeled \u201cproject redeployment,\u201d was to buy a large company and then partially\nspin off its various divisions. In LTV\u2019s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: \u201cMostimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.\u201d The press, the public and WallStreet loved this sort of talk.\nIn 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and\npharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson SportingGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly becameknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.\nSoon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s,\nLing\u2019s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.\nPeriodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality \u2013 you can count on that. More Jimmy\nLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers willfight for their business.

And when someone tells youhow old-fashioned that math is --- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks atcheap prices.\n************\nToday Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoying\nfavorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devotedto both the subsidiary they operate andto Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financial\nstrength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under allcircumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among\nmany owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to thepreceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50years to develop and that is now rock-solid.\nThese strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.\n33\n\nThe Next 50 Years at Berkshire\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what\nwas coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what Iwould say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire\u2019s future.\n\u2039First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshireshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments.", "t Berkshire\u2019s future.\n\u2039First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshireshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That\u2019s because our per-shareintrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.\nThis cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor\u2019s entry point into\nBerkshire stock is unusually high \u2013 at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shareshave occasionally reached \u2013 it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In otherwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshireis not exempt from this truth.\nPurchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company\nwould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire\u2019sdirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our\nview, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)\nFor those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer noassurances,\nwhatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods willlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic valueof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: \u201cIn the short-term the market is a votingmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.\u201d Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors \u2013amateurs and professionals alike \u2013 border on lunacy.\nSince I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire\nshares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years.", "ssionals alike \u2013 border on lunacy.\nSince I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire\nshares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should look\nelsewhere.\nAnother warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three\ntimes since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close tothis kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be asatisfactory holding for investors . But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing\nleverage.\n\u2039I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero.We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jacketsto the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a \u201cfirst responder\u201d during the 2008-2009meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earningspotential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.\nFinancial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under allcircumstances: (1) a large\nand reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) nosignificant near-term cash\nrequirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpectedproblems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturingobligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindsetcan be.\nHere\u2019s how we will always stand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes from\na vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitiveadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future.", "nings stream is huge and comes from\na vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitiveadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire\u2019scontinued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previouslyexperienced.\n34\n\nNext up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized \u2013 as an\nunproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business asoxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.\nAmerican business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperous\ncompanies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, theirfinancial oxygen disappeared.\nAt Berkshire, our \u201cbreathing\u201d went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late September\nand early October, we supplied $15.6 billion of fresh money to American businesses.\nWe could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion \u2013 and usually far more \u2013 in cash\nequivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed todeliver liquidity and actually do so, except when it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legal\ntender. Don\u2019t leave home without it.\nFinally \u2013 getting to our third point \u2013 we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can\nresult in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debtmaturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require largecollateral calls.\nSome years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly\nmispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements.", "t could require largecollateral calls.\nSome years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly\nmispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable.Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that endedour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for someyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.\nMoreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.\nMany lifeinsurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a \u201crun\u201d in times of\nextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. Ifour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline \u2013 but only at a very slow pace.\nThe reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely\npredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Thoughpractically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is always uncertain. (I felt no special apprehension\non December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can\u2019t predict what tomorrow will bring, youmust be prepared for whatever it does.\nA CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have\nonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be \u201cright\u201d 99% of the time. Those odds,however, hold no appeal for us.

Those odds,however, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you\u2019veentrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it ismadness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire .\n\u2039Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning\npower of Berkshire. That does notmean operating earnings will increase each year \u2013 far from it. The U.S.\neconomy will ebb and flow \u2013 though mostly flow \u2013 and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. Butwe will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe,therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.\nIn some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition,\nand chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep movingforward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we willpurchase. In most years, moreover, our country\u2019s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. Weare blessed to have the United States as our home field.\n35\n\n\u2039The bad news is that Berkshire\u2019s long-term gains \u2013 measured by percentages, not by dollars \u2013 cannot be\ndramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big.\nI think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won\u2019t begreat.\nEventually \u2013 probably between ten and twenty years from now \u2013 Berkshire\u2019s earnings and capital resources\nwill reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company\u2019s earnings. Atthat time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings isthrough dividends, share repurchases or both.", "ntly reinvest all of the company\u2019s earnings. Atthat time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings isthrough dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value,massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directorswill make the right decision.\n\u2039No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annuallyreaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: \u201cAlthough our form iscorporate, our attitude is partnership.\u201d This covenant with you is etched in stone.\nWe have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out that\npromise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere,our directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshireshares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.\nThe shares that they and their families own \u2013 which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums \u2013 were\npurchased in the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlike\nalmost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. AtBerkshire, directors walk in your shoes.\nTo further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non-\nexecutive Chairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should ever\nbe employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that thisproblem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire \u2013 likely as low as at any public company.", "be employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that thisproblem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire \u2013 likely as low as at any public company. In my\nservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I\u2019ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocreCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)\nIf elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all\ndirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about theCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors beapprehensive, Howard\u2019s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.\n\u2039Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire boardmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection andretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires thereplacement of a subsidiary\u2019s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire\u2019s CEO to be arational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights intohuman behavior. It\u2019s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, \u201cI\u2019m nogenius, but I\u2019m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.\u201d)\nCharacter is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be \u201call in\u201d for the company, not for himself. (I\u2019m using male\npronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can\u2019t helpbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it\u2019s important that neither ego nor avaricemotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements farexceed theirs.", "cess of any possible need for it. But it\u2019s important that neither ego nor avaricemotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements farexceed theirs. A CEO\u2019s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it\u2019s clear to them thatshareholders\u2019 interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way ofthinking.\n36\n\nMy successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay,\nwhich are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even thestrongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintainfriendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.\nIn their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Their\nstrengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them tofall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-timefinancial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.\nOnly a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger.\nHe must never forget Charlie\u2019s plea: \u201cTell me where I\u2019m going to die, so I\u2019ll never go there.\u201d If our non-economic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire\u2019s economic value would collapse as well. \u201cTone at thetop\u201d will be key to maintaining Berkshire\u2019s special culture.\nFortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinary\ndelegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense,Berkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we havenever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many usethem as an important internal tool).", "rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we havenever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many usethem as an important internal tool). We don\u2019t have a legal office nor departments that other companies takefor granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.\nWe do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a damned fool. To an unusual degree,\nhowever, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, theywere doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore,our trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews andlayers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what wewould wish for, if the positions were reversed.\n\u2039Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshireboard has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relativelyyoung, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average wellover ten years at the helm. (It\u2019s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65either (or have you noticed?).\nIn both Berkshire\u2019s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our\ncounterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire\u2019s CEO. Developing confidence ofthat sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.\nBoth the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO \u2013 a successor ready to\nassume the job the day after I die or step down.", "ips takes time.

Overall, though, our investmentmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. ToddCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire\u2019s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.\nAll told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right\npeople in place \u2013 the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, bothgood and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners andoperating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kindandpermanent home.\n37\n\n\u2039I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders.\nBerkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation.", "home.\n37\n\n\u2039I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders.\nBerkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation.

And they would never tell outsiders about it.\nBoth the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I\nknow of has half of such elements in place.\nHow did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire\u2019s shares and was completely trusted\nby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshiresystem.\nAlmost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire\u2019s\nachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire\u2019ssubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while usingdifferent systems.\nWhat was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:\n(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most\nimportant people in the system, starting with himself.\n(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually\nstayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.\n(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at\nheadquarters.\n(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.\nWhen Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into\nsome benefits through practice evolution.", "aham, to the spread of wisdom attained.\nWhen Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into\nsome benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.\n40\n\nWhy did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?\nOnly four large factors occur to me:\n(1) The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,\n(2) The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,(3) Good luck, and(4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the\npress.\nI believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive\npeculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.\nIn particular, Buffett\u2019s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to\nkeep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became goodat tennis.\nBuffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most\nregularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponentsalways faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improvedmore than was normal.\nAnd Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person,\nnot seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deterioratinglike the skill of a basketball player does.\nMoreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,\nBuffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there.", "a basketball player does.\nMoreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,\nBuffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs andthe achievements of the subsidiaries.\nThen, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and\nBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries intoBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.\nAnd the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a\n\u201cvirtuous circle.\u201d\nHow well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?Marvelously well. Berkshire\u2019s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders\u2019 equity, as\ndid Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during thelast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.\nAnd, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries greatly\noutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire\u2019sstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurancebusiness that produced both a huge \u201cfloat\u201d and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,followed by a quadrupling of GEICO\u2019s market share.", "out of nothing an immense reinsurancebusiness that produced both a huge \u201cfloat\u201d and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,followed by a quadrupling of GEICO\u2019s market share. And the rest of Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations hugelyimproved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches,and recruiting and holding outstanding people.\n41\n\nThen, later, as Berkshire\u2019s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well\nknown, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buyprivately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.\nBerkshire\u2019s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a\nproducer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire\u2019s betteroutcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a smallbase while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.\nDid Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widened\narea for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett\u2019s skills.\nWhy did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything in\nexchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.\nWhy did Berkshire\u2019s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire\nshareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?\nWell, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the\nequivalent of a \u201cdepartment of acquisitions\u201d under pressure to buy.", "of the acquirer?\nWell, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the\nequivalent of a \u201cdepartment of acquisitions\u201d under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from \u201chelpers\u201dsure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertisewhile he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn\u2019t in business, aided by his longexperience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than mostothers, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten yearsin control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, fora net gain of one.\nWhat were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common,\nalmost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure towork out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire\u2019s net worth would now be atleast $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtuallysure things.\nThe next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett\nwere soon to depart.\nThe answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable\ncompetitive advantage.\nMoreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new\nfixed assets.", "much business momentum grounded in much durable\ncompetitive advantage.\nMoreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new\nfixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions.\nProvided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present\nis so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never againpurchased a large business.\nBut, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be \u201cof only moderate ability.\u201d For\ninstance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as \u201cworld-class.\u201d\u201cWorld-leading\u201d would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better businessexecutive than Buffett.\nAnd I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire\nmuch change in the Berkshire system.\n42\n\nNor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett\u2019s departure. With Berkshire now\nso large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and thatBerkshire\u2019s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.\nMy final task was to consider whether Berkshire\u2019s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may\nprove useful elsewhere.\nThe answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large\nand useful company.", "0 years have implications that may\nprove useful elsewhere.\nThe answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large\nand useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leaderfor a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.\nCompare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession of\nCEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixedretirement age.\nI believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes of\nbureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example ofbureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress theright to ignore seniority in choosing generals.\nSincerely,Charles T.

Starting in 1979,\naccounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects ,\nthe results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .I fa\ncorporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*\nDuring the first half of those years, Berkshire\u2019s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business.", "to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*\nDuring the first half of those years, Berkshire\u2019s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax thatwould be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part\u201cmarked to market.\u201d\nBy the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that\ndiminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that applyto controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carryingvalue of the \u201closers\u201d we own is written down, but \u201cwinners\u201d are never revalued upwards.\nWe\u2019ve had experience with both outcomes: I\u2019ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for the\neconomic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire\u2019s book value. We\u2019vealso had some winners \u2013 a few of them very big \u2013 but have not written those up by a penny.\nOver time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap\nbetween intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large \u2013 and growing \u2013 unrecorded gains at our \u201cwinners\u201d make itclear that Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value farexceeds its book value. That\u2019s why we would be delighted to repurchase\nour shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfullyincrease per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire\u2019s continuing shareholders.\nThe unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire\u2019s aggregate market-\nvalue gain \u2013 tabulated on the facing page \u2013 materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators varyerratically over short periods.", "owned businesses explains why Berkshire\u2019s aggregate market-\nvalue gain \u2013 tabulated on the facing page \u2013 materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators varyerratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however,market-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nThe Year at Berkshire\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire\u2019s normalized earning\npower to increase every year. ( Actual year-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weakness\nin the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains will\nbe small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:\n\u2039 The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to betterearnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service tocustomers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capitalexpenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annualdepreciation charge. It was money well spent.\nBNSF moves about 17% of America\u2019s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether\ntransported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among theseven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freightthan our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to ourshippers\u2019 welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.\nFor most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year.", "maintaining first-class service is not only vital to ourshippers\u2019 welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.\nFor most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings\nweakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion*(a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks anddeserve yours.\n\u2039 BNSF is the largest of our \u201cPowerhouse Five,\u201d a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy,Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies \u2013 our five most profitable non-insurancebusinesses \u2013 earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.\nOf the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003.\nSubsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. Thatsatisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\n\u2039 Next year, I will be discussing the \u201cPowerhouse Six.\u201d The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.(\u201cPCC\u201d), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectlyinto the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earning power.\nUnder CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world\u2019s premier supplier of aerospace components (mostof them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark\u2019saccomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkableIsraeli manufacturer of cutting tools.", "ent, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark\u2019saccomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkableIsraeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinaryproducts that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.\nPCC\u2019s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft.\nOther industries are served as well by the company\u2019s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13countries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We lookforward to having him deploy Berkshire\u2019s capital.\n* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\n4\n\nA personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of\nour own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educateme about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers\u2013 they each handle about $9 billion for us \u2013 both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshirein other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.\n\u2039With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 101\u20444companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they\nwere stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the1\u20444.) That leaves just under 98% of\nAmerica\u2019s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.\n\u2039Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two thatearned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million,six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and$100 million.", "00 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million,six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and$100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings asthe years go by.\n\u2039When you hear talk about America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they\u2019re not talking aboutBerkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed inthe United States.\nI told you earlier about BNSF\u2019s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of every year, our railroad\u2019s\nphysical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion in\nrenewables and now owns 7% of the country\u2019s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is sixtimes the\ngeneration of the runner-up utility.\nWe\u2019re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables in\nsupport of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, bothfor the environment and for Berkshire\u2019s economics.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 \u2013 thatmakes 13 years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During those years, our float \u2013 money that doesn\u2019t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neitherthat gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\u2019s earnings, float generates significant investmentincome because of the assets it allows us to hold.\nMeanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billion\nearned in 2015.", "rates significant investmentincome because of the assets it allows us to hold.\nMeanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billion\nearned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire\u2019s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business.We\u2019ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can\u2019t be replicated.\n\u2039While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-onacquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The costof these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.\nCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren\u2019t.)\nThese purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managedby our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, acombination we find highly appealing. We will make many dozens of bolt-on deals in future years.\n5\n\n\u2039Our Heinz partnership with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Alex Behring and Bernardo Hees more than doubled its\nsize last year by merging with Kraft. Before this transaction, we owned about 53% of Heinz at a cost of$4.25 billion. Now we own 325.4 million shares of Kraft Heinz (about 27%) that cost us $9.8 billion. Thenew company has annual sales of $27 billion and can supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with yourOscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favoritemeal. (We will have the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at the annual meeting \u2013 bring your kids.)\nThough we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, \u201cGAAP\u201d (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required us\nto record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger.", "ring your kids.)\nThough we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, \u201cGAAP\u201d (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required us\nto record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger. That leaves us with ourKraft Heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billionsbelow its market value, an outcome only an accountant could love.\nBerkshire also owns Kraft Heinz preferred shares that pay us $720 million annually and are carried at $7.7\nbillion on our balance sheet. That holding will almost certainly be redeemed for $8.32 billion in June (theearliest date allowed under the preferred\u2019s terms). That will be good news for Kraft Heinz and bad news forBerkshire.\nJorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners. We share with them a passion to buy, build and\nhold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires. We follow different paths, however, in pursuing\nthis goal.\nTheir method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer an\nopportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then \u2013 very promptly \u2013 to make the moves that will\nget the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America\u2019seconomic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per workinghour \u2013 that\u2019s the measure of productivity gains \u2013 an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporateAmerica, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and hisassociates .\nAt Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow\nan approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by\ncost-conscious and efficient managers.", "etest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow\nan approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by\ncost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, ourrole is simply to create an environment in\nwhich these CEOs \u2013 and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded \u2013 can maximize boththeir managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs. (With this hands-off style, I amheeding a well-known Mungerism: \u201cIf you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure tomarry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.\u201d)\nWe will continue to operate with extreme \u2013 indeed, almost unheard of \u2013 decentralization at Berkshire. But\nwe will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was thecase when his group purchased Tim Horton\u2019s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz.We also may occasionally partner with others, as we have successfully done at Berkadia.\nBerkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostile\noffers are justified: Some CEOs forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working, while othermanagers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant tomake the change required. That\u2019s when new faces are needed. We, though, will leave these \u201copportunities\u201dfor others. At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.\n6\n\n\u2039Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 American\nExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the othertwo companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership.", "ownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the othertwo companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership. Ourequity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8%to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren\u2019t important, consider this math: For thefour companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire\u2019sportion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.\nThese four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. Their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering. At Berkshire, wemuch prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% ofa so-so business. It\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\nIf Berkshire\u2019s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2015 earnings\namounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends theypay us \u2013 about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies\u2019earnings we don\u2019t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\nThe earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move that increases\nBerkshire\u2019s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of thesecompanies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous.

All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time. Ifgains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capitalgains.\nOur flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\nbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they willoperate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chanceof finding a date on Saturday night. In like manner \u2013 well, not exactly like manner \u2013 our appetite for eitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles ourchances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire\u2019s\nendless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpileof funds that can be tapped when an elephant-sized acquisition is offered to us.\n************\nIt\u2019s an election year, and candidates can\u2019t stop speaking about our country\u2019s problems (which, of course,\nonly theycan solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will not\nlive as well as they themselves do.\nThat view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that \u2013 in real terms \u2013 is a\nstaggering six times the amount in 1930, the year I was born, a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents ortheir contemporaries.

Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more.", "eir contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than didAmericans in 1930. Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more. This all-powerful trend iscertain to continue: America\u2019s economic magic remains alive and well.\nSome commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP \u2013 and, yes, we would all like to\nsee a higher rate. But let\u2019s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, deliversastounding gains.\n7\n\nAmerica\u2019s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from net\nmigration). Thus 2% of overall growth produces about 1.2% of per capita growth. That may not sound impressive.\nBut in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in realGDP per capita.\n(Compounding\u2019s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.)In turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation.\nWere that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today\u2019s politiciansneed not shed tears for tomorrow\u2019s children.\nIndeed, most of today\u2019s children are doing well. Allfamilies in my upper middle-class neighborhood\nregularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth.

Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goodsand services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm,between the inheritors and the Horatio Algers, between investors and workers and, in particular, between those withtalents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hard-working Americans who lack the skillsthe market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us \u2013 and will forever continue. Congress will be thebattlefield; money and votes will be the weapons. Lobbying will remain a growth industry.\nThe good news, however, is that even members of the \u201closing\u201d sides will almost certainly enjoy \u2013 as they\nshould \u2013 far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past. The quality of their increased bounty\nwill also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want \u2013 nor, even moreso, in delivering what people don\u2019t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a televisionset, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do,quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter,\u201csearch\u201d is invaluable to me. (I\u2019m not ready for Tinder, however.)\nFor 240 years it\u2019s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start.

And, yes, America\u2019s kids will live far better than theirparents did.\n************\nConsidering this favorable tailwind, Berkshire (and, to be sure, a great many other businesses) will almost\ncertainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value byfollowing our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries;(2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees;(4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and(5) making an occasional large acquisition. Management will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever,\nissuing Berkshire shares.\n8\n\nIntrinsic Business Value\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\nis for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our2010 annual report we laid out the three elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to anestimation of Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased\n8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses \u2013including insurance underwriting income \u2013 increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor\nthe dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-countingof value.", "g income \u2013 increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor\nthe dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-countingof value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortizationand minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax .\nI used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting\nincome in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire\u2019s two quantitative pillars ofvaluation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn\u2019tblow and the earth didn\u2019t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order tobe conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break evenover time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.\nToday, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we\nhave deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the secondparagraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and weanticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year couldwell be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our\nearnings ( including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip.", "r per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our\nearnings ( including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is no\ncoincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that ofour two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operatingearnings.\n************\nNow, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our\nintent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you beingthe reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don\u2019t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) branch of that industry has been the engine that\nhas propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, NationalFire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is farin excess of the value at which it is carried on our\nbooks.\n9\n\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensationaccidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit.", "his collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322015 87,722\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized\noperations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, is party toa number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will bevery gradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can\nnever be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This\nstructure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire\u2019s economic fortress. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss,\nin effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float.", "competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss,\nin effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insuranceindustry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest ratesthe world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many yearsto come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It\u2019s a good bet that industry results over the next tenyears will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize inreinsurance.\nAs noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive\nyears, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That\u2019s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation isthe daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned\nby poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testamentstyle.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount of\nour float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of\nfloat as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses \u2013 a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 \u2013 and that reduces float.", "is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses \u2013 a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 \u2013 and that reduces float. Just assurely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.\n10\n\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying our\ninsurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on\nits true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, anygoodwill\nasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it \u2013 to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion we\ncarry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our\nfloat.", "excess of its historic carrying value.

Its value today is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business valuesubstantially exceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\nIndeed, Berkshire is farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to writebusiness in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurerswould be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\nWhen Ajit entered Berkshire\u2019s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\u2019s experience in the\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to ourreinsurance business.", "office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\u2019s experience in the\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to ourreinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions ofvalue for Berkshire shareholders.\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\n11\n\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s huge\nfloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused\ncommentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago.

So stopreading \u2013 right now! \u2013 and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.\nGEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\nyear. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control ofGEICO.)

In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed,over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting \u2013 about 13% of its premium volume \u2013while increasing its float from $943 million to $9.9 billion.\nLess than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d), which we include\nin this group. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge. That move was a home run: BHSI has alreadydeveloped $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter\u2019s direction, is destined to become one of theworld\u2019s leading P/C insurers.\n12\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of underwriting earnings and float by division:\nUnderwriting Profit Yearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2015 2014 2015 2014\nBH Reinsurance ............................... $ 4 2 1 $ 6 0 6 $ 44,108 $ 42,454\nGeneral Re ................................... 1 3 2 2 7 7 18,560 19,280\nGEICO ...................................... 4 6 0 1,159 15,148 13,569\nOther Primary ................................. 8 2 4 6 2 6 9,906 8,618\n$ 1,837 $ 2,668 $ 87,722 $ 83,921\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by wide\nmoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them\nfrom our other businesses.", "ly get more valuable with time.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them\nfrom our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combinedfinancial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% ofBerkshire\u2019s after-tax operating earnings.\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage wasmore than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, notEBITDA/\ninterest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.\nThe first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-wideningdiversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Thesemany sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowedBHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us andour\ncustomers.\nAll told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment to\nkey components of America\u2019s infrastructure.", "is economic fact benefits both us andour\ncustomers.\nAll told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment to\nkey components of America\u2019s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonablereturns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\nhuge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providersin a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\nLow prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE\u2019s average retail rate is\n6.8\u00a2 per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5\u00a2. Here are the comparable industryfigures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0\u00a2, Missouri 9.3\u00a2, Illinois 9.3\u00a2, Minnesota 9.7\u00a2. The national average is10.4\u00a2. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\n13\n\nAt BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant\ndifferences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a very crude measure,\nhowever, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3\u00a2 last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other fourmajor U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2\u00a2 to 5.3\u00a2.\nBoth BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology.

(Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take thatfigure to 58% in 2017.)\nBNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost\n500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highwaycongestion \u2013 and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic \u2013 in a major way.\nHere are the key figures for BHE and BNSF:\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2015 2014 2013\nU.K. utilities ..................................................... $ 4 6 0 $ 5 2 7 $ 3 6 2\nIowa utility ...................................................... 3 1 4 2 9 8 2 3 0\nNevada utilities .................................................. 5 8 6 5 4 9 (58)\nPacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah) ............................... 1,026 1,010 982\nGas pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ........................ 4 0 1 3 7 9 3 8 5\nCanadian transmission utility ........................................ 1 7 0 1 6 \u2014\nRenewable projects ............................................... 1 7 5 1 9 4 5 0\nHomeServices ................................................... 1 9 1 1 3 9 1 3 9\nOther (net) ...................................................... 2 7 2 6 1 2\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes .................... 3,350 3,138 2,102\nInterest ......................................................... 4 9 9 4 2 7 2 9 6\nIncome taxes .................................................... 4 8 1 6 1 6 1 7 0\nNet earnings ..................................................... $ 2,370 $ 2,095 $ 1,636\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire .....................................", "................... 4 8 1 6 1 6 1 7 0\nNet earnings ..................................................... $ 2,370 $ 2,095 $ 1,636\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ..................................... $ 2,132 $ 1,882 $ 1,470\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2015 2014 2013\nRevenues ....................................................... $ 21,967 $ 23,239 $ 22,014\nOperating expenses ............................................... 14,264 16,237 15,357\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes ............................ 7,703 7,002 6,657\nInterest (net) ..................................................... 9 2 8 8 3 3 7 2 9\nIncome taxes .................................................... 2,527 2,300 2,135\nNet earnings ..................................................... $ 4,248 $ 3,869 $ 3,793\nI currently expect increased after-tax earnings at BHE in 2016, but lower earnings at BNSF.\n14\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

The \u201cnon-real\u201d charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.\nThe table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We now\nhave $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.Eventually, of course, every dollar of these \u201cassets\u201d will be charged off. When that happens, reported earningsincrease even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)\nI suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I do\nthat, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that areall too real. \u201cStock-based compensation\u201d is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u201ccompensation.\u201dIf compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation ofearnings, where in the world do they belong?\nWall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring\n\u201cearnings\u201d figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don\u2019t know any better. Or maybe theyfear losing \u201caccess\u201d to management.", "arade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring\n\u201cearnings\u201d figures fed them by managements.

Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else isplaying the game, why shouldn\u2019t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty ofpropagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.\nDepreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are at\nBerkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in51 years I\u2019ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business fallsfar short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAPearnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) WhenCEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noseslengthen while they speak.\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract somethingto reflect BNSF\u2019s inadequate depreciation charge.\n************\nLet\u2019s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging\nfrom lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector\u2019s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible\nassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Othersgenerate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\nA few, however \u2013 these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation \u2013 have very poor\nreturns.", "5% after-tax to far more than 100%. Othersgenerate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\nA few, however \u2013 these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation \u2013 have very poor\nreturns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or theindustry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled inevaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit moreerrors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\nof $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash andusing only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.\n16\n\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capitalwe have deployed in this sector. Earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as Duracell andPrecision Castparts enter the fold.\n************\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their\ncompetitors \u2013 both current and potential \u2013 read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required.", "r businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of ouroperations on pages 88-91.\nFinance and Financial Products\nOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and\nMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies areindustry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. Ateach of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that\u2019spaid off. Dealing from strength is one of Berkshire\u2019s enduring advantages.\nKevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largest\nhome builder in America. Last year, the company sold 34,397 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes boughtby Americans. In contrast, the company was number three in the field, with a 14% share, when Berkshire purchasedit in 2003.\nManufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-income\ncitizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton\u2019shomes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate. Most of Clayton\u2019s remaining sales are made to1,395 independent retailers.\nKey to Clayton\u2019s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all\nmortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, withthe balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market onlythe homes of our competitors.\nLenders other than Clayton have come and gone.", "ation, withthe balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market onlythe homes of our competitors.\nLenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire\u2019s backing, however, Clayton steadfastly\nfinanced home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used preciouscapital to finance dealers who did notsell our homes. The funds we supplied to Goldman Sachs and General Electric\nat that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownershippossible for thousands of families and kept many non-Clayton dealers alive.\nOur retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers of\nalternative sources for financing \u2013 most of it coming from local banks \u2013 and always secure acknowledgments fromcustomers that this information has been received and read.

There is no\nquestion that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008,which in turn led to the Great Recession.", "both the borrower and to society. There is no\nquestion that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008,which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corruptpattern of mortgage creation flourished whereby (1) an originator in, say, California would make loans and(2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package manymortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold tounwitting institutions around the world.\nAs if these sins weren\u2019t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimes\nconcocted a second layer of sliced-up financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings.(When Wall Street gets \u201cinnovative,\u201d watch out!) While that was going on, I described this \u201cdoubling-up\u201d practiceas requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single securitybeing offered.\nBoth the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by\nvolume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applicationswhile mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. SmoothWall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable tounderstand.

(It\u2019s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the morecomplex structures. But rate them they did.)\nBarney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessed\nthe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, \u201cThe one major weakness that I\u2019ve seen in the implementation was this decisionby the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.\u201d Today, some legislators andcommentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that ofthe ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.\nAt Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving aside\nthe few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay aprice \u2013 a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had toforeclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.\nThe average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but a\ndaunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home \u2013 take a look at thehome we will have on display at our annual meeting \u2013 requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments thataverage $522.\nSome borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths.

We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose hisdown payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental ratesfor comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their paymentbehavior during the Great Recession was farbetter than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people\nearning multiples of our typical borrower\u2019s income.\nThe strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we\u2019ve done well with our\nmortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short-term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us aconstantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, whichbears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds andfinanced the position in some short-term manner.)\n18\n\nNormally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at\nClayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn\nshort-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range. If we have, say,$60 billion invested at\n1\u20444% or less, a sharp move to higher short-term rates would bring benefits to us far exceeding\nthe higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton\u2019s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms,Berkshire is \u2013 and always will be \u2013 heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.\nLet me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation.", "d always will be \u2013 heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.\nLet me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. The\nGreat Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to beassessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties.\nThe scrutiny has certainly extended to Clayton, whose mortgage practices have been continuously\nreviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations, servicing, collections, advertising, compliance, andinternal controls. At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing andUrban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During thepast two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and itsmortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers$704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year,95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.\n************\nMarmon\u2019s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by the\ncompany\u2019s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30.

That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America\u2019s remarkable gains in livingstandards since the nation\u2019s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of \u201csecret\u201d is appropriate: Too fewAmericans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity.", "rkable gains in livingstandards since the nation\u2019s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of \u201csecret\u201d is appropriate: Too fewAmericans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let\u2019s look first at thecountry\u2019s most dramatic example \u2013 farming \u2013 and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.\nIn 1900, America\u2019s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of the\ntotal, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to itsproduction and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.\nThen came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity\nas planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn.Productivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billionbushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.\nIncreased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been\naccompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (\u201chuman input\u201d). Today about three millionpeople work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods haveallowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation ofhuman resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they\nwould otherwise lack.\nIt\u2019s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural\ninnovations have been \u2013 not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anythingclose to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity.", "l\ninnovations have been \u2013 not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anythingclose to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horsescouldn\u2019t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the \u201cgreater good\u201d must have rung hollow to farm hands wholost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We willexamine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.\nFor the moment, however, let\u2019s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences\nfor Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.\n\u2039In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved byClass I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.\nBy 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only\n187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-relatedemployees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggeringimprovement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars.\nAnother startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need\nwell over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employmentwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today\u2019s volume would actually move.)\n21\n\nOur own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe.", "mentwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today\u2019s volume would actually move.)\n21\n\nOur own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, the\nmerged company\u2019s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000employees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees(plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF hasimproved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen morethan 50% to 0.95.\n\u2039A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures carsand their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies \u2013 the kinddealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwritingexpenses that consumed about 40\u00a2 of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver\u2019sseat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another whencommissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine \u2013except for the consumer.\nAnd then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came up\nwith the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. Hisbaby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses \u2013 moves thatpermitted lower prices \u2013 and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been therunaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner\u2019s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with adirect distribution model, was long the runner-up.", "werhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been therunaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner\u2019s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with adirect distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwritingexpenses of about 25%.\nIn the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (\u201cUSAA\u201d), a mutual-like\ncompany, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketinginnovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as theymoved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted thesteady renewals that came from permanent residents.\nThe direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by State\nFarm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and LillianGoodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution modelbeyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated GovernmentEmployees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).\nTheir fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did\n$22.6 billion , more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second\nmouse gets the cheese.) GEICO\u2019s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAAbeing the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA butspends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)\nWith the price advantage GEICO\u2019s low costs allow, it\u2019s not surprising that several years ago the company\nseized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm,though it is still far ahead of us in volume.", "not surprising that several years ago the company\nseized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm,though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 \u2013 my 100\nthbirthday \u2013 I plan to announce\nthat GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.\nGEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the\nworkforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe,however, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in directemployment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.\n22\n\n\u2039In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) operates within a changing\neconomic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. Infact, a \u201csloppy\u201d operation could do just fine financially.\nThat\u2019s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a\nlevel that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that autility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss\u2019s office.And some CEOs ran things accordingly.\nThat\u2019s all changing.

That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a periodduring which industry rates increased 44%.\nThe safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015\ncompared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.\nIn 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our\npurchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year thenumbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically,with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE nowranks in the industry\u2019s top decile.\nThose outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a\nutility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliableoperation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paida dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership.", "y will run an efficient, safe and reliableoperation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paida dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership. No investor-owned utility in America comes close tomatching BHE\u2019s enthusiasm for reinvestment.)\n************\nThe productivity gains that I\u2019ve just spelled out \u2013 and countless others that have been achieved in America\n\u2013 have delivered awesome benefits to society. That\u2019s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed \u2013 and willcontinue to enjoy \u2013 major gains in the goods and services they receive.\nTo this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely\nbenefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay aterrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.\nWe need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public\nshareholders). It\u2019s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from gooddecisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who\ndiversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winninginvestments have always farmore than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average \u2013 an index fund of sorts \u2013 soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the whilepaying ever-increasing dividends.)\n23\n\nA long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to\nproduce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decentemployment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.\nWhen low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,\nputting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work.", "re; for others, that is not an option.\nWhen low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,\nputting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they couldlearn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood theycould not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, whichstruggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spokePortuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.\nThe answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.\nAmericans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever beemployed in farming.\nThe solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to\nwork but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformedand expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) Theprice of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for theunfortunate.\nImportant Risks\nWe, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog \u201crisk factors\u201d in our 10-K. I\ncan\u2019t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K\u2019s \u201crisk\u201d section has helped me in evaluating a business.That\u2019s not because the identified risks aren\u2019t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known.Beyond that, a 10-K\u2019s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening eventactually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss.", "0-K\u2019s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening eventactually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that willonly surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financial problem for today\u2019s investor.\nBerkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own array\nof possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOsoften differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that mayresult from these possibilities.\nLet me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, is\ncertain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future \u2013 though not, in my view,\nfor a long time \u2013 GEICO\u2019s premium volume mayshrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our\nauto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for whenpurchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storagecapabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers andcertain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us \u2013 but eventhe most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.\nNone of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire\u2019s long-term well-being. When we took over the\ncompany in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: \u201cThe northern textile business inwhich all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.\u201d That development,however, was no death knell. We simply adapted.", "ce: \u201cThe northern textile business inwhich all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.\u201d That development,however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.\n24\n\nEvery day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing\nworld. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect,we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believethat Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I\u2019ve itemized above \u2013 andmany more \u2013 and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.\nThere is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are\npowerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a \u201csuccessful\u201d (as defined by theaggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all\nof American business.\nThe probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It\u2019s been more than 70\nyears since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the firstatomic bomb. Subsequently, we\u2019ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank ourgovernment \u2013 and luck! \u2013 for this result.\nNevertheless, what\u2019s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there is\nonly one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in acentury is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps evennations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increasedexponentially during my lifetime.", "here will forever be people and organizations and perhaps evennations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increasedexponentially during my lifetime. \u201cInnovation\u201d has its dark side.\nThere is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S.\nthat leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.\nNo one knows what \u201cthe day after\u201d will look like. I think, however, that Einstein\u2019s 1949 appraisal remains\napt: \u201cI know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks andstones.\u201d\n************\nI am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this\nyear\u2019s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might presentto our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.\nIt seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say \u201chighly likely\u201d\nrather than \u201ccertain\u201d because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most \u201cexperts\u201dabout Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage tothe world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting thedanger.\nThis issue bears a similarity to Pascal\u2019s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued\nthat if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because therewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy.", "lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy. Call this Noah\u2019s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival , begin building it today, no matter how\ncloudless the skies appear.\nIt\u2019s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by\nclimate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that propertylosses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- ortwenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repricedannually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.\n25\n\nThink back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company\u2019s average loss-per-policy\nwas then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increaseto about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn\u2019t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.\nOver the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans\ninvolved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable . If costs had\nremained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather thanone doing $23 billion.\nUp to now, climate change has notproduced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-\nrelated events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years,\nwhich is why we have backed away from that business.", "ly hurricanes nor other weather-\nrelated events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years,\nwhich is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely \u2013though far from certain \u2013 effect on Berkshire\u2019s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.\nAs a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a\nlow-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a majorinsurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.\nThe Annual Meeting\nCharlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21\nstCentury. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast\nworldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m.Central Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30\nth. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with\nmanagers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.\nThis new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at\nthe meeting. Last year\u2019s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling theCenturyLink Center\u2019s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms atthe adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb\u2019s stepped-up presence. Airbnbwas especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.\nOur second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we were\npartners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look inoccasionally to make sure we hadn\u2019t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come toOmaha to monitor how we look and sound.", "nning the place, you would want to look inoccasionally to make sure we hadn\u2019t drifted off into la-la land.

(In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn\u2019tlook that impressive when we were at our best.)\nViewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume\nenough Coke, See\u2019s fudge and See\u2019s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman.

Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late last\nmonth, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in thosewho work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entirehome office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.\n26\n\nLast year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the CenturyLink.

An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink\u2019s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour orso and can safely be skipped by those craving a little last-minute shopping.\nYour venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\nproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale.

Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we findfascinating, such as some very personal letters sent by Grover Cleveland to Edward Butler, his friend and the then-publisher of The Buffalo News . Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the price\nremains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000 available forsale at the meeting.\nMy friend, Phil Beuth, has written Limping on Water , an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital\nCities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke.

Starting in 1979,\naccounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which\nwas previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all otherrespects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are\nafter-tax . If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have\nlagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed anegative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2016 was $27.5 billion, which increased the per-share book value\nof both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.7%. Over the last 52 years (that is, since present management took\nover), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $172,108, a rate of 19% compounded annually.*\nDuring the first half of those years, Berkshire\u2019s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the taxthat would be incurred if they were to be sold).", "ures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the taxthat would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very largepart \u201cmarked to market.\u201d\nBy the early 1990s, however, our focus was changing to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift\nthat materially diminished the relevance of balance sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because theaccounting rules (commonly referred to as \u201cGAAP\u201d) that apply to companies we control differ in important waysfrom those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesses we own requires that\nthe carrying value of \u201closers\u201d be written down when their failures become apparent. \u201cWinners,\u201d conversely, arenever revalued upwards.\nWe\u2019ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliver\nsurprises after the \u201cI do\u2019s.\u201d I\u2019ve made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill of\ncompanies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire\u2019s bookvalue. We\u2019ve also had some winners among the businesses we\u2019ve purchased \u2013 a few of the winners very big \u2013but have not written those up by a penny.\nWe have no quarrel with the asymmetrical accounting that applies here. But, over time, it necessarily\nwidens the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and its book value. Today, the large \u2013 and growing \u2013unrecorded gains at our winners produce an intrinsic value for Berkshire\u2019s shares that farexceeds their book\nvalue. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many otheroperations.\nOver time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value.", "exceeds their book\nvalue. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many otheroperations.\nOver time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value. That\u2019s what has happened at Berkshire, a fact\nexplaining why the company\u2019s 52-year market-price gain \u2013 shown on the facing page \u2013 materially exceeds itsbook-value gain.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof\nthose shown for A.\n3\n\nWhat We Hope to Accomplish\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire\u2019s normalized\nearning power per share to increase every year. Actual earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of\nperiodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specific\nevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.\nIt\u2019s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your\ncapital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire rankedfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting manybillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.\nSome years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the\ncash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to beprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons.", "Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\nI earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment\nactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps \u2013making small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire\u2019s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketablesecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for$434 million in 1993. Dexter\u2019s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,giving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.\nThat wreck was followed by three key happenings \u2013 two positive, one negative \u2013 that set us firmly on\nour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn\u2019t already own, a cashtransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.GEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believeis now the world\u2019s premier property/casualty business.\nUnfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock \u2013 a boatload of\nstock \u2013 to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fineinsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares ofBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%.", "peration that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares ofBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My errorcaused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that \u2013 despite the Biblicalendorsement \u2013 is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).\nEarly in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of MidAmerican Energy, a\nbrilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable andsocially-useful investments. The MidAmerican cash purchase \u2013 I was learning \u2013 firmly launched us on our\npresent course of (1) continuing to build our insurance operation; (2) energetically acquiring large and diversifiednon-insurance businesses and (3) largely making our deals from internally-generated cash. (Today, I would ratherprep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares.)\nOur portfolio of bonds and stocks, de-emphasized though it is, has continued in the post-1998 period to\ngrow and to deliver us hefty capital gains, interest, and dividends. Those portfolio earnings have provided usmajor help in financing the purchase of businesses. Though unconventional, Berkshire\u2019s two-pronged approachto capital allocation gives us a real edge.\n4\n\nHere\u2019s our financial record since 1999, when the redirection of our business began in earnest.

By our avoiding the issuance of Berkshire stock, anyimprovement in earnings will translate into equivalent per-share gains.\n************\nOur efforts to materially increase the normalized earnings of Berkshire will be aided \u2013 as they have been\nthroughout our managerial tenure \u2013 by America\u2019s economic dynamism. One word sums up our country\u2019sachievements: miraculous.", "rease the normalized earnings of Berkshire will be aided \u2013 as they have been\nthroughout our managerial tenure \u2013 by America\u2019s economic dynamism. One word sums up our country\u2019sachievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago \u2013 a span of time less than triple my days onearth \u2013 Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitiousimmigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.\nYou need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you.\nSee the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productivefactories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it \u2013 they all represent a net gain forAmericans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, Americahas amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.\n5\n\nIt\u2019s true, of course, that American owners of homes, autos and other assets have often borrowed heavily\nto finance their purchases. If an owner defaults, however, his or her asset does not disappear or lose its\nusefulness. Rather, ownership customarily passes to an American lending institution that then disposes of it to anAmerican buyer. Our nation\u2019s wealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, \u201cMoney is always there, but the\npockets change.\u201d\nAbove all, it\u2019s our market system \u2013 an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor \u2013\nthat has created America\u2019s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards.Governmental redirection, through federal, state and local taxation, has in addition determined the distribution ofa significant portion of the bounty.\nAmerica has, for example, decided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the old\nand the young. Such forms of aid \u2013 sometimes enshrined as \u201centitlements\u201d \u2013 are generally thought of as applyingto the aged.", "ided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the old\nand the young. Such forms of aid \u2013 sometimes enshrined as \u201centitlements\u201d \u2013 are generally thought of as applyingto the aged. But don\u2019t forget that four million American babies are born each year with an entitlement to a publiceducation. That societal commitment, largely financed at the local level, costs about $150,000 per baby. Theannual cost totals more than $600 billion, which is about 3\n1\u20442% of GDP.\nHowever our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almost\nexclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Thoseholdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet: Ourcitizens own assets abroad that are\nroughly comparable in value.\nEarly Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those people\nwho toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashedhuman potential, and their successors built upon it.\nThis economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, the\nbuild-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not ,however, be stopped. I\u2019ll\nrepeat what I\u2019ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are theluckiest crop in history.\n************\nAmerica\u2019s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20\nth\ncentury the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materiallyboosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced afurther 72%, to 19,763.\nAmerican business \u2013 and consequently a basket of stocks \u2013 is virtually certain to be worth far more in\nthe years ahead.", "end continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced afurther 72%, to 19,763.\nAmerican business \u2013 and consequently a basket of stocks \u2013 is virtually certain to be worth far more in\nthe years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that.Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on thenonsense they peddle.\nMany companies, of course, will fall behind, and some will fail. Winnowing of that sort is a product of\nmarket dynamism. Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines \u2013 even panics \u2013that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur \u2013 not me, not Charlie, noteconomists, not the media. Meg McConnell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: \u201cWespend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us.\u201d\nDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as\nan investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be\nunwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with acollection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.\nAs for Berkshire, our size precludes a brilliant result: Prospective returns fall as assets increase.\nNonetheless, Berkshire\u2019s collection of good businesses, along with the company\u2019s impregnable financial strengthand owner-oriented culture, should deliver decent results. We won\u2019t be satisfied with less.\n6\n\nShare Repurchases\nIn the investment world, discussions about share repurchases often become heated. But I\u2019d suggest that\nparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn\u2019t that complicated.\nFrom the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus.", "gest that\nparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn\u2019t that complicated.\nFrom the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus. Though the day-to-day impact of\nthese purchases is usually minuscule, it\u2019s always better for a seller to have an additional buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price\nbelow intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic\nvalue. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is boughtout by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exitingpartner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies withcorporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing orvalue-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.\nIt is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above\nwhich repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn\u2019t be the case if a management was buying an outsidebusiness. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision.\nWhen CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seem\noblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few ownersand were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not.\nIt is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place,\neven if the company\u2019s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money toprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need forfunds should take priority.", "One is when a business both needs all its available money toprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need forfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting itafter the needed expenditures are made.\nThe second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investment\nopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,Berkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely toarise.\nMy suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, join\nhands and in unison declare, \u201cWhat is smart at one price is stupid at another.\u201d\n************\nTo recap Berkshire\u2019s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at\n120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant andmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount toBerkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can\u2019t be precise.\nThe authorization given me does not mean that we will \u201cprop\u201d our stock\u2019s price at the 120% ratio. If\nthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creatingprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.\nTo date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear in\ndescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value issignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that\u2019s fine.", "because we have been clear in\ndescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value issignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that\u2019s fine. Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell ina fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price \u2013 it\u2019s nofun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases \u2013 nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out\u201cpartners\u201d at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances couldcreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will beready to act.\n7\n\nOne final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people\nhave come close to calling them un-American \u2013 characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds\nneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn\u2019t the case: Both American corporations and private investorsare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I\u2019m not aware of anyenticing project that in recent\nyears has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)\nInsurance\nLet\u2019s now look at Berkshire\u2019s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.\nThe property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades.", "s its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding largesums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float fortheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does ourfloat. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322016 91,577\nWe recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-time\nboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. NationalIndemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certainto drift downward.\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to\nimmediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is bydesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will never be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces.", "r be\ncompromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, weenjoy the use of free money \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\nvigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\n8\n\nThis outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout the\nworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies \u2013 though notthose of Berkshire \u2013 are heavily\nconcentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding a\npittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it\u2019s a good bet that industryresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case ofcompanies that specialize in reinsurance.\nNevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire\u2019s unrivaled financial strength allows us far\nmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to usare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, ourchoices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion.", "er, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. Thatrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know\nthat while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give thatmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s book value is calculated, the fullamount\nof our float is deducted as a liability , just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to\nthink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims and related expenses \u2013 a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 \u2013 and thatreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding tofloat.\nIf our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go outthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\nA partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying\nour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, has nobearing on its true value.", "re. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged\nunderwriting losses, anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original\ncost.\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\ninsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\noperation possessing it \u2013 to be farin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion\nwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.Yet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.This unrecorded asset is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value farexceeds its book value.\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\ndisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about themajor units.\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures\nrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposesBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, Berkshire is farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers.", "insurance business. Yet he never exposesBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9\n\nIndeed, Berkshire is farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple\nanything it has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a large profit for the year. Our manystreams of non-insurance earnings would see to that. Additionally, we would remain awash in cash and be eagerto write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers andreinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\nWhen Ajit entered Berkshire\u2019s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\u2019s experience in the\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to oursmall and struggling reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has createdtens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap mefor him, don\u2019t hesitate . Make the trade!\n************\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed until recently by Tad Montross. After\n39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.Kara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines.", "in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.Kara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profitafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can\u2019t be obtained.\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on\nbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we mustas well,\u201d spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to thatnonsensical excuse for sloppy underwriting, and neither will Kara.\n************\nFinally, there is GEICO, the company that set my heart afire 66 years ago (and for which the flame still\nburns). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 55 years of service in2016.\nTony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is nobetter\nmanager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication andsoundness to the job. (The latter\nquality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it\u2019s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ \u2013 unless hethinks it\u2019s 180.) Like Ajit, Tony has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire.\nOn my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company\nenjoyed over the giants of the industry.

In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operationthat consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually one much superior to that reported by their competitors.Over the past 14 years, this group has earned $4.7 billion from underwriting \u2013 about 13% of its premiumvolume \u2013 while increasing its float from $943 million to $11.6 billion.\nLess than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d), which is\nincluded in this grouping. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge, a move that proved to be ahome run: We expected significant losses in the early years while Peter built the personnel and infrastructureneeded for a world-wide operation. Instead, he and his crew delivered significant underwriting profits throughoutthe start-up period. BHSI\u2019s volume increased 40% in 2016, reaching $1.3 billion. It\u2019s clear to me that thecompany is destined to become one of the world\u2019s leading P/C insurers.\nHere\u2019s a recap of pre-tax underwriting earnings and float by division:\nUnderwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2016 2015 2016 2015\nBH Reinsurance .................................... $ 822 $ 421 $ 45,081 $ 44,108\nGeneral Re ........................................... 190 132 17,699 18,560\nGEICO ................................................ 462 460 17,148 15,148\nOther Primary ....................................... 657 824 11,649 9,906\n$2,131 $1,837 $ 91,577 $ 87,722\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide\nmoats amount to something unique in the insurance world.", "9,906\n$2,131 $1,837 $ 91,577 $ 87,722\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide\nmoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuable.\nRegulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d), our 90%-owned utility business, share\nimportant characteristics that distinguish them from Berkshire\u2019s other activities. Consequently, we assign them\ntheir own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet andincome statement. These two very major companies accounted for 33% of Berkshire\u2019s after-tax operatingearnings last year.\n11\n\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets,\nwith these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nin fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would\nfar exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF\u2019s interestcoverage was more than 6:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes tointerest, notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\nAt BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under all\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from thesecompanies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by fewother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed byany single regulatory body.", "ch demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by fewother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed byany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of thecompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lowertheir cost of debt. That economic fact benefits both us andour customers.\nAll told, BHE and BNSF invested $8.9 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment\nto their segments of America\u2019s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promisereasonable returns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\nOur confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\nneed huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.\nLow prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE\u2019s average retail rate is\n7.1\u00a2 per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.9\u00a2. Here are the comparableindustry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0\u00a2, Missouri 9.5\u00a2, Illinois 9.2\u00a2, Minnesota 10.0\u00a2. The nationalaverage is 10.3\u00a2. We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest . Our\nrock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\nAt BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of\nsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried.", "ustomers.\nAt BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of\nsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very\ncrude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3\u00a2 last year, while shipping costs for customers of theother four major U.S.-based railroads ranged from 4\u00a2 to 5\u00a2.\nBoth BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no\nstate comes close to rivaling Iowa, where last year the megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 55% ofall megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. New wind projects that are underway will take that figureto 89% by 2020.\nBargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large high-\ntech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) andbecause most tech CEOs are enthusiastic about using renewable energy. When it comes to wind energy, Iowa isthe Saudi Arabia of America.\nBNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight\nalmost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroadsalleviate highway congestion \u2013 and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heaviertraffic \u2013 in a major way.\n12\n\nAll told, BHE and BNSF own assets that are of major importance to our country as well as to\nshareholders of Berkshire.

I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rulesregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periodsaveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization \u201cexpenses\u201d are not truly an economic cost.Our goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way inwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.\nOn page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges to\nearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we showthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015. My judgmentis that about 20% of the 2016 charge is a \u201creal\u201d cost.\nEventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens \u2013 most often at the\n15-year mark \u2013 the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlyingeconomics of Berkshire\u2019s business. (My gift to my successor.)\nNow that I\u2019ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less\npleasant distortion produced by accounting rules.", "of Berkshire\u2019s business. (My gift to my successor.)\nNow that I\u2019ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less\npleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,which are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understate true\neconomic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, wheninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided \u2013 thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker \u2013 the inadequacy ofdepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time , in the railroad industry,\nwhere current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reportedearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.\n15\n\nAt BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion. But were\nwe to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive.\nThe reality is that \u2013 simply to hold our own \u2013 we need to spend far more than the cost we show for depreciation.\nMoreover, a wide disparity will prevail for decades.\nAll that said, Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our better purchases.\n************\nToo many managements \u2013 and the number seems to grow every year \u2013 are looking for any means to\nreport, and indeed feature , \u201cadjusted earnings\u201d that are higher than their company\u2019s GAAP earnings. There are\nmany ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of\u201crestructuring costs\u201d and \u201cstock-based compensation\u201d as expenses.\nCharlie and I want managements, in their commentary , to describe unusual items \u2013 good or bad \u2013 that\naffect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of thefuture.", "anagements, in their commentary , to describe unusual items \u2013 good or bad \u2013 that\naffect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of thefuture. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting \u201cadjustedper-share earnings\u201d makes us nervous. That\u2019s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look forways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be \u201chelpful\u201d as well. Goalslike that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed manyindustry participants.\nCharlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always \u201cmake the\nnumbers.\u201d In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur.When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make up the numbers.\nLet\u2019s get back to the two favorites of \u201cdon\u2019t-count-this\u201d managers, starting with \u201crestructuring.\u201d\nBerkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northerntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year atBerkshire. That\u2019s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, asI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.\nWe have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our\nnormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mentionit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinzmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations beexplained clearly to owners.", "ing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinzmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations beexplained clearly to owners. That\u2019s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved bythe company\u2019s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, \u201cDon\u2019t count this,\u201d whenmanagement is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts andjournalists fall for this baloney.\nTo say \u201cstock-based compensation\u201d is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that\nroad are, in effect, saying to shareholders, \u201cIf you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don\u2019t worryabout its effect on earnings. I\u2019ll \u2018adjust\u2019 it away.\u201d\nTo explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accounting\nlaboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire\u2019s reported earnings. Imaginative technicians await us, eager\nto show their stuff.\n16\n\nListen carefully while I tell these enablers that stock-based compensation usually comprises at least 20%\nof total compensation for the top three or four executives at most large companies. Pay attention, too, as I explain\nthat Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but usesonly cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted allof these payments to\nBerkshire\u2019s executives as an expense.\nMy accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these\nBerkshire managers is tantamount to \u201ccash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation\u201d and is therefore not a\u201ctrue\u201d expense.", "ns suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these\nBerkshire managers is tantamount to \u201ccash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation\u201d and is therefore not a\u201ctrue\u201d expense. So \u2013 presto! \u2013 Berkshire, too, can have \u201cadjusted\u201d earnings.\nBack to reality: If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they should\nbe required to affirm to their owners one of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not a\ncost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings.\nDuring the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960s, the story was told of a CEO who, as\nhis company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, \u201cWhat is two plus two?\u201d The answer that wonthe assignment, of course, was, \u201cWhat number do you have in mind?\u201d\nFinance and Financial Products\nOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and\nMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader in\nits field.\nWe also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the sale\nof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earnings from its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton\nbecame America\u2019s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new Americanhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollar volume than Clayton because they sell site-built\nhomes that command much higher prices.)\nIn 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in\n2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton\u2019s unit sales in 2017and will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.\nEven so, Clayton\u2019s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new\nAmerican homes costing less than $150,000.", "n 2017and will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.\nEven so, Clayton\u2019s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new\nAmerican homes costing less than $150,000. Clayton manufactures close to one-half of the total. That is a far cryfrom Clayton\u2019s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry inunits sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is14,677. And that number will increase in the future.\nClayton\u2019s earnings in recent years have materially benefited from extraordinarily low interest rates. The\ncompany\u2019s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years atinception). But Clayton\u2019s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge,Clayton\u2019s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrow-short approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire isalways asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidated earnings, even as they\nhurt at Clayton.\n17\n\nLast year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its total\nportfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton\u2019s customers are usually lower-income\nfamilies with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many,similarly, have financial profiles that will be damaged by divorce or death to an extent that would not be typicalfor a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have astrong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,including the cost of insurance and property taxes.\nClayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties.", "because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,including the cost of insurance and property taxes.\nClayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular are\nloan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had$3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest orfees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Our experience is that 93% of borrowers helped through theseprograms in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums onforeclosures \u2013 losses last year totaled $150 million \u2013 our assistance programs end up helping Clayton as well asits borrowers.\nClayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership. Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-class\nmanagement group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured-home industry fell apart during the Great Recession. (As other lenders to the industry vanished, Clayton suppliedcredit not only to its own dealers but also to dealers who sold the products of its competitors.) At Berkshire, wenever count on synergies when we acquire companies. Truly important ones, however, surfaced after ourpurchase of Clayton.\nMarmon\u2019s railcar business experienced a major slowdown in demand last year, which will cause\nearnings to decline in 2017. Fleet utilization was 91% in December, down from 97% a year earlier, with the dropparticularly severe at the large fleet we purchased from General Electric in 2015. Marmon\u2019s crane and containerrentals have weakened as well.\nBig swings in railcar demand have occurred in the past and they will continue. Nevertheless, we very\nmuch like this business and expect decent returns on equity capital over the years. Tank cars are Marmon\u2019sspecialty.", "car demand have occurred in the past and they will continue. Nevertheless, we very\nmuch like this business and expect decent returns on equity capital over the years. Tank cars are Marmon\u2019sspecialty. People often associate tank cars with the transportation of crude oil; in fact, they are essential to a greatvariety of shippers.\nOver time, we expect to expand our railcar operation. Meanwhile, Marmon is making a number of\nbolt-on acquisitions whose results are included in the Manufacturing, Service and Retailing section.\nHere\u2019s the pre-tax earnings recap for our finance-related companies:\n2016\n2015 2014\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share) ............................................ $ 91 $ 74 $ 122\nClayton .................................................................... 744 706 558\nCORT ...................................................................... 60 55 49\nMarmon \u2013 Containers and Cranes ................................. 126 192 238\nMarmon \u2013 Railcars ..................................................... 654 546 442\nXTRA ..................................................................... 179 172 147\nNet financial income* ................................................. 276 341 283\n$ 2,130 $ 2,086 $ 1,839\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n18\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

Included in the $21 billion that the two\nmanage is about $7.6 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pensioninvestments are not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.\n************\nExcluded from the table \u2013 but important \u2013 is our ownership of $5 billion of preferred stock issued by\nBank of America. This stock, which pays us $300 million per year, also carries with it a valuable warrantallowing Berkshire to purchase 700 million common shares of Bank of America for $5 billion at any time beforeSeptember 2, 2021. At yearend, that privilege would have delivered us a profit of $10.5 billion. If it wishes,Berkshire can use its preferred shares to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrant.\n19\n\nIf the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock \u2013 now 30 cents annually \u2013 should rise above\n44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the\ncommon dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediatelybefore it expires.\nMany of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite\naggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most casesbeen underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows andoutstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.\n************\nIt\u2019s important for you to understand that 95% of the $86 billion of \u201ccash and equivalents\u201d (which in my\nmind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax.", "f \u201ccash and equivalents\u201d (which in my\nmind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax. Moreover, repatriation of the remaining funds would triggeronly minor taxes because much of that money has been earned in countries that themselves impose meaningfulcorporate taxes. Those payments become an offset to U.S. tax when money is brought home.\nThese explanations are important because many cash-rich American companies hold a large portion of\ntheir funds in jurisdictions imposing very low taxes. Such companies hope \u2013 and may well be proved right \u2013 thatthe tax levied for bringing these funds to America will soon be materially reduced. In the meantime, thesecompanies are limited as to how they can use that cash. In other words, off-shore cash is simply not worth asmuch as cash held at home.\nBerkshire has a partial offset to the favorable geographical location of its cash, which is that much of it\nis held in our insurance subsidiaries. Though we have many alternatives for investing this cash, we do not havethe unlimited choices that we would enjoy if the cash were held by the parent company, Berkshire. We dohave\nan ability annually to distribute large amounts of cash from our insurers to the parent \u2013 though here, too, there arelimits. Overall, cash held at our insurers is a very valuable asset, but one slightly less valuable to us than is cashheld at the parent level.\n************\nSometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks \u201cforever.\u201d It is\ntrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we\u2019re talking20/20 vision).", "holders or media imply that we will own certain stocks \u201cforever.\u201d It is\ntrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we\u2019re talking20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold anyof its marketable securities forever.\nConfusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on\npages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled\nbusinesses , not marketable securities. This year I\u2019ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners\nunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.\n************\nBefore we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,\nlike most corporations, nets considerably more from a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capital\ngains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains asthe route to tax-favored returns.\nBut here\u2019s the corporate math. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it\n35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic\ncorporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.\n20\n\nFor a non-insurance company \u2013 which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent \u2013 the federal tax rate is\neffectively 101\u20442cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends.", "he federal tax rate is\neffectively 101\u20442cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to the\nsubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid itsown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applying\nto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualtycompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% ifthey own more than 20% of a U.S.-based investee.\nAnd that\u2019s our tax lesson for today.\n\u201cThe Bet\u201d (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)\nIn this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,\nnext, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, aunique establishment that played a role in the bet.\nLong Bets was seeded by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization that\nadministers just what you\u2019d guess: long-term bets.

They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the otherside of the bet. When a \u201cdoubter\u201d steps forward, each side names a charity that will be the beneficiary if its sidewins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.When the bet is concluded, Long Bets pays off the winning charity.\nHere are examples of what you will find on Long Bets\u2019 very interesting site:\nIn 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that \u201cBy 2029 no computer \u2013 or \u2018machine intelligence\u2019 \u2013 will\nhave passed the Turing Test,\u201d which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being.\nInventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don\u2019t know who willwin this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.\nThat same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers\nby 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburnEric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. Hepromptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I\u2019ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment,should we lose.)\nNow, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire\u2019s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment\nmanagement by professionals \u2013 in aggregate \u2013 would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved byrank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of \u201chelpers\u201d would leavetheir clients \u2013 again in aggregate \u2013 worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index\nfund.", "I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of \u201chelpers\u201d would leavetheir clients \u2013 again in aggregate \u2013 worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index\nfund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)\n21\n\nSubsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least\nfive hedge funds \u2013 wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles \u2013 that would over an extended period match\nthe performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet andnamed a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade offund managers \u2013 who could include their own fund as one of the five \u2013 to come forth and defend theiroccupation. After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting\na little of their own money on the line?\nWhat followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managers\nwho have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man \u2013 Ted Seides \u2013stepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, an asset manager that had raised moneyfrom limited partners to form a fund-of-funds \u2013 in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.\nI hadn\u2019t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money where\nhis mouth was.

The five he selected had invested their money inmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not bedistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.\nEach fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedge\nfunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlyinghedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fundmanagers.\nHere are the results for the first nine years of the bet \u2013 figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,\nthe charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly openingthe mail next January.\nYear\nFund of\nFunds AFund of\nFunds BFund of\nFunds CFund of\nFunds DFund of\nFunds ES&PIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -2.9% 1.7% -1.4% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%Gain toDate 8.7% 28.3% 62.8% 2.9% 7.5% 85.4%\nFootnote: Under my agreement with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never\nbeen publicly disclosed. I, however, see their annual audits.\nThe compounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return that could easily\nprove typical for the stock market over time. That\u2019s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large \u201cshort\u201d positions.", "tant fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large \u201cshort\u201d positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stockswould have provided a tailwind for index funds.\nInstead we operated in what I would call a \u201cneutral\u201d environment. In it, the five funds-of-funds\ndelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested inthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000.\n22\n\nBear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a huge\nfinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected were\nsimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled toperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.\nI\u2019m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But\nthe results for their investors were dismal \u2013 really dismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the\nfunds and funds-of-funds involved \u2013 fees that were totally unwarranted by performance \u2013 were such that theirmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might haveput it: \u201cFees never sleep.\u201d\nThe underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners that\nlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of \u201c2 and 20,\u201d meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by badones).", "under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of \u201c2 and 20,\u201d meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by badones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator\u2019s ability to simply pile up assets undermanagement has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performedpoorly.\nStill, we\u2019re not through with fees. Remember, there were the fund-of-funds managers to be fed as well.\nThese managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite theterrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected\u201cperformance\u201d fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% \u2013 gulp! \u2013 of allgains\nachieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegottenreward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could haveeffortlessly \u2013 and with virtually nocost \u2013 achieved on their own.\nIn my opinion, the disappointing results for hedge-fund investors that this bet exposed are almost certain\nto recur in the future. I laid out my reasons for that belief in a statement that was posted on the Long Bets websitewhen the bet commenced (and that is still posted there). Here is what I asserted:\nOver a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2017,the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance ismeasured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.\nA lot of very smart people set out to do better than average in securities markets. Call them\nactive investors.\nTheir opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate their\npositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance ofthe universe\u2014the active investors\u2014must do about average as well.", "finition do about average. In aggregate their\npositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance ofthe universe\u2014the active investors\u2014must do about average as well. However, theseinvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costswill be worse than those of the passive investors.\nCosts skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs are\nall added to the active investor\u2019s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this costproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge fundsin which the funds of funds are invested.\nA number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their\nefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose oninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fundthan with a group of funds of funds.\n23\n\nSo that was my argument \u2013 and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)\nand Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve average\nresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requiresme to mention that there is a very minor point \u2013 not worth detailing \u2013 that slightly modifies this formulation.)\nAnd if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.\nThere are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over long\nstretches. In my lifetime, though, I\u2019ve identified \u2013 early on \u2013 only ten or so professionals that I expected would\naccomplish this feat.\nThere are no doubt many hundreds of people \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 whom I have never met and whose\nabilities would equal those of the people I\u2019ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible.", "eat.\nThere are no doubt many hundreds of people \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 whom I have never met and whose\nabilities would equal those of the people I\u2019ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible. The problem simplyis that the great majority of managers who attempt to over-perform will fail. The probability is also very high thatthe person soliciting your funds will not be the exception who does well. Bill Ruane \u2013 a truly wonderful humanbeing and a man whom I identified 60 years ago as almost certain to deliver superior investment returns over thelong haul \u2013 said it well: \u201cIn investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to theswarming incompetents.\u201d\nFurther complicating the search for the rare high-fee manager who is worth his or her pay is the fact that\nsome investment professionals, just as some amateurs, will be lucky over short periods. If 1,000 managers makea market prediction at the beginning of a year, it\u2019s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nineconsecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet.But there would remain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest with\nhim.\nFinally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a good\nrecord quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investmentperformance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will neverthelessseek new money because of their personal equation \u2013 namely, the more funds they have under management, the\nmore their fees.\nThese three points are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million ,I\nwrote my limited partners: \u201cI feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to helpthem.", "are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million ,I\nwrote my limited partners: \u201cI feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to helpthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up toher to find some other partnership for them.\u201d\nThe bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will\nusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stickwith low-cost index funds.\n************\nIf a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-\ndown choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who havepromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing \u2013 or, as in our bet, lessthan nothing \u2013 of\nadded value.\nIn his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,\nhowever, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on theirsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\n************\nOver the years, I\u2019ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I\u2019ve\nlearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 indexfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\n24\n\nI believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed\nthat same advice when I\u2019ve given it to them.", "dest means have usually followed my suggestion.\n24\n\nI believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed\nthat same advice when I\u2019ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and\ndepart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out anotherbreed of hyper-helper called a consultant.\nThat professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients,\nyear after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Largefees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. Thatadvice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment \u201cstyles\u201d or currenteconomic trends make the shift appropriate.\nThe wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,\nentertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy themsomething superior compared to what the masses receive.\nIn many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason,\nthe financial \u201celites\u201d \u2013 wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like \u2013 have great troublemeekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a fewthousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is \u2013on anexpectancy basis \u2013 clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elitefor superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money inhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns.", "more than $100 billion over the past decade.Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money inhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall isconservative.\nMuch of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds are\nwoefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performanceaccompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by localtaxpayers.\nHuman behavior won\u2019t change. Wealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like will\ncontinue to feel they deserve something \u201cextra\u201d in investment advice. Those advisors who cleverly play to thisexpectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. Thelikely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: \u201cWhen a person with money meets a personwith experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with money leaves withexperience.\u201d\nLong ago, a brother-in-law of mine, Homer Rogers, was a commission agent working in the Omaha\nstockyards. I asked him how he induced a farmer or rancher to hire him to handle the sale of their hogs or cattleto the buyers from the big four packers (Swift, Cudahy, Wilson and Armour). After all, hogs were hogs and thebuyers were experts who knew to the penny how much any animal was worth. How then, I asked Homer, couldany sales agent get a better result than any other?\nHomer gave me a pitying look and said: \u201cWarren, it\u2019s not how you sell \u2018em, it\u2019s how you tell \u2018em.\u201d\nWhat worked in the stockyards continues to work in Wall Street.\n************\nAnd, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.\nBerkshire loves to pay fees \u2013 even outrageous fees \u2013 to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions.", "And, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.\nBerkshire loves to pay fees \u2013 even outrageous fees \u2013 to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions.

Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually.*\nThe format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: A\nlarge portion of our gain did notcome from anything we accomplished at Berkshire.\nThe $65 billion gain is nonetheless real \u2013 rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire\u2019s\noperations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code.(Details of Berkshire\u2019s tax-related gain appear on page K-32 and pages K-89 \u2013 K-90.)\nAfter stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire\u2019s operations. But,\nin still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule \u2013 a generally accepted accountingprinciple (GAAP) \u2013 that in future quarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire\u2019s net income figures and\nvery often mislead commentators and investors.\nThe new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be\nincluded in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capriciousswings in our GAAP bottom-line.", "investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be\nincluded in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capriciousswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of KraftHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.Including gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe ouroperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire\u2019s \u201cbottom-line\u201d will be useless.\nThe new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realized gains\n(or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,we have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they \u2013 just like our unrealized gains\u2013 fluctuate randomly.\nThat\u2019s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are trying\nto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period whenour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).\n*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof those\nshown for the A shares.\n3\n\nWith the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying to\nrealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of ournumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaperheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income.", "nse of ournumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaperheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reportssometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.\nWe will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late on\nFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysisand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.Nevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.\nAt Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is what\nCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on \u2013 and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.\nAcquisitions\nThere are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-on\nacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our manyand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, wewill review 2017 acquisition activity.\nIn our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;\nable and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price .\nThat last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far\nfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high.", "inally, a sensible purchase price .\nThat last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far\nfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimisticpurchasers.\nWhy the purchasing frenzy? In part, it\u2019s because the CEO job self-selects for \u201ccan-do\u201d types. If Wall Street\nanalysts or board members urge that brand of CEO to consider possible acquisitions, it\u2019s a bit like telling your ripeningteenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.\nOnce a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates\nwill be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporatesize. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need ahaircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large \u201csynergies\u201d will beforecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.\nThe ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, even\na high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluateacquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low and that to assign a large portionof our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debtdedicated to Clayton\u2019s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also neverfactor in, nor do we often find, synergies.\nOur aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us\nbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don\u2019t need.", "Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us\nbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don\u2019t need. We held this view 50 yearsago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also holdit today after a million or so \u201cpartners\u201d have joined us at Berkshire.\n4\n\nDespite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have\nopportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less theprudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\n************\nWe were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot Flying\nJ (\u201cPFJ\u201d). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation\u2019s leading travel-centeroperator.\nPFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. \u201cBig Jim\u201d Haslam began with a dream\nand a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughoutNorth America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023;Haslam family members will then own the remaining 20%. Berkshire is delighted to be their partner.\nWhen driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good. If it\u2019s\nbeen a long day, remember, too, that our properties have 5,200 showers.\n************\nLet\u2019s move now to bolt-on acquisitions. Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here is\nan account, however, of a few larger purchases whose closings stretched between late 2016 and early 2018.\n\u0160 Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubled\nour presence in a field we entered only three years ago.", "tched between late 2016 and early 2018.\n\u0160 Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubled\nour presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions \u2013 Oakwood Homes in Colorado andHarris Doyle in Birmingham \u2013 I expect our 2018 site built volume will exceed $1 billion.\nClayton\u2019s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing.\nIn 2017 Clayton sold 19,168 units through its own retail operation and wholesaled another 26,706 units to independentretailers. All told, Clayton accounted for 49% of the manufactured-home market last year. That industry-leading share\u2013 about three times what our nearest competitor did \u2013 is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year itjoined Berkshire.\nBoth Clayton Homes and PFJ are based in Knoxville, where the Clayton and Haslam families have long been\nfriends. Kevin Clayton\u2019s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiringcomments about the Haslam family to me, helped cement the PFJ deal.\n\u0160 Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U.S. Floors (\u201cUSF\u201d), a rapidly\ngrowing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF\u2019s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gatefast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw\u2019s. It\u2019s clearthat we acquired both great human assets andbusiness assets in making the USF purchase.\nVance Bell, Shaw\u2019s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw\u2019s\nsales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantiallystrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\n\u0160 I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation.", "s substantiallystrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\n\u0160 I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshire\nbacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in MidAmerican Energy (now named BerkshireHathaway Energy). MidAmerican\u2019s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid littleattention to HomeServices.\n5\n\nBut, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, HomeServices was the second-largest\nbrokerage operation in the country \u2013 still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,HomeServices\u2019 growth exploded. We acquired the industry\u2019s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12,Houlihan Lawrence; and Gloria Nilson.\nWith those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. HomeServices is now close to\nleading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of\u201csides\u201d during 2017. To explain that term, there are two \u201csides\u201d to every transaction; if we represent both buyer andseller, the dollar value of the transaction is counted twice.\nDespite its recent acquisitions, HomeServices is on track to do only about 3% of the country\u2019s home-\nbrokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this mostfundamental of businesses.\n\u0160 Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz GmbH, a\nGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components.

Please allow me to skip a furtherexplanation. I don\u2019t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, homebuilders or truck stops.\nFortunately, I don\u2019t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision,\nis an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on peoplecan sometimes be more certain than betting on physical assets.\nLet\u2019s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (\u201cp/c\u201d) insurance, a business I do\nunderstand and the engine that for 51 years has powered Berkshire\u2019s growth.\nInsurance\nBefore I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. We\nbegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With ourpurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able todeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned atBerkshire itself. In effect, we were \u201ctrading dollars\u201d for the net worth portion of the cost.\nThe $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usually\ndelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of \u201cfloat\u201d\u2013 money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.\nEver since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire.", "but was held by our two insurers.\nEver since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,are on our tab as well.)\nFloat materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfront\nwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, suchas car repairs, are quickly paid, others \u2013 such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos \u2013 may take many years tosurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, ofa person employed by one of our workers\u2019 compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafterrequiring expensive lifetime care.\n6\n\nFloat generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines of\nbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability \u2013 business labeled \u201clong-tail\u201d in industry jargon \u2013 thatgenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediatelymake payments to claimants for needed repairs.\nBerkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumbo\nreinsurance policies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of our\nemphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire\u2019s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country\u2019s secondlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.\nHere\u2019s the record:\n(in $ millions)\nYear\nPremium Volume Float\n1970 $ 39 $ 39\n1980 185 2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500\nOur 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\nAIG had incurred.", "2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500\nOur 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\nAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world\u2019s record and one we won\u2019t come close torepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.\nFloat will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it will\nbe modest \u2013 at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrenderoptions, p/c float can\u2019t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can\u2019t experience massive \u201cruns\u201d in times ofwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investmentdecisions.\nCharlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers \u2013 or even\nthat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked havingTreasury Bills \u2013 loads of Treasury Bills \u2013 that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines\nor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortablywithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures.\n************\nThe downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurance\ncan be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. Inthe 1980\u2019s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,threatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\nlong prioritized those qualities.", "oried operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\nlong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in suchinstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the\nearlier table.\nI have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light period\nthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significanthurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n7\n\nMy guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,\nhowever, could be faroff the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran\nlow. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-gradedexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer\u2019sfinancial condition for a very long time.\nWe currently estimate Berkshire\u2019s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion after\ntax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry losswas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in futureAmerican mega-cats.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worth\nby less than 1%.

The damage to them could have been farworse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a\npath through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.\nWe believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insured\nlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increasesover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.\nNo company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share\nof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insuranceactivities. Concurrently, much \u2013 indeed, perhaps most \u2013 of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleledfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire \u2013 and only Berkshire \u2013 when they, themselves,\nneed to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.\nPrior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3\nbillion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,but also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax fromunderwriting.\nA large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K at\nthe back of this report.

You can read moreabout these businesses on pages K-5 \u2013 K-10 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-44.\nProceeding down Berkshire\u2019s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked by\nearnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol,Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4billion these companies earned in 2016.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1\nbillion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2016.\n8\n\nThe remaining businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 recorded little change in pre-tax\nincome, which was $3.7 billion in 2017 versus $3.5 billion in 2016.\nDepreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were\n$11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expendituresthat far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America\u2019seconomic soil remains fertile.\nAmortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a true\neconomic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciationcharges that fall well short of the sums regularly needed to keep the railroad in first-class shape.\nBerkshire\u2019s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we\nwill need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so.

This extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level Charlie and I wish Berkshire tohave.

I feel confident, however, that the\nearnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate intocommensurate capital gains for Berkshire.\nThe connection of value-building to retained earnings that I\u2019ve just described will be impossible to detect in\nthe short term.

Now I have the final tally \u2013 and, inseveral respects, it\u2019s an eye-opener.\nI made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sum\nthat \u2013 if things turned out as I expected \u2013 would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) topublicize my conviction that my pick \u2013 a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund \u2013 would,over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded andincentivized those \u201chelpers\u201d may be.\nAddressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually to\nadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money\u2019sworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anything for their outlays?\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five \u201cfunds-of-funds\u201d that it expected to overperform\nthe S&P 500. That was nota small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedge\nfunds.\nEssentially, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund.", "t\u00e9g\u00e9, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. Thisassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.\nThe managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could \u2013 and did \u2013 rearrange\ntheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new \u201cstars\u201d while exiting their positions in hedgefunds whose managers had lost their touch.\nEvery actor on Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund\nmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally movesupwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500\nexceeded loss years.)\nThose performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich.", "Those performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\nfunds lostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich.

Then the roof fell in. In\nevery one of the nine years that followed, the funds-of-funds as a whole trailed the index fund.\nLet me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch.\nIf a poll of investment \u201cexperts\u201d had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, theirguesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in thatenvironment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street \u201chelpers\u201d earned staggering sums. While this groupprospered, however, many of their investors experienced a lost decade.\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.\n************\nThe bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, they\noccasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does notrequire great intelligence, a degree in\neconomics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is anability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to lookunimaginative for a sustained period \u2013 or even to look foolish \u2013 is also essential.\nOriginally, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000\nface amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called \u201cstrips\u201d). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 \u2013a bit less than 64\u00a2 on the dollar \u2013 with the $500,000 payable in ten years.\nAs the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were\npurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity.", ",000 payable in ten years.\nAs the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were\npurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I originally intended to do no more thantally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017.\n12\n\nAfter our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012,\nour bonds \u2013 now with about five years to go before they matured \u2013 were selling for 95.7% of their face value. At that\nprice, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88% .\nGiven that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb \u2013 a really dumb \u2013 investment compared to\nAmerican equities. Over time, the S&P 500 \u2013 which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriatelyweighted by market value \u2013 has earned farmore than 10% annually on shareholders\u2019 equity (net worth).\nIn November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cash return from dividends on the S&P 500 was 2\n1\u20442%\nannually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use theirretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,over time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And \u2013 as has been the case since 1776 \u2013 whatever its problems ofthe minute, the American economy was going to move forward.\nPresented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and\nI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire \u201cB\u201d shares.The result: Girls Inc.", "y valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and\nI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire \u201cB\u201d shares.The result: Girls Inc. of Omaha found itself receiving $2,222,279 last month rather than the $1 million it had originallyhoped for.\nBerkshire, it should be emphasized, has not performed brilliantly since the 2012 substitution. But brilliance\nwasn\u2019t needed: After all, Berkshire\u2019s gain only had to beat that annual .88% bond bogey \u2013 hardly a Herculeanachievement.\nThe only risk in the bonds-to-Berkshire switch was that yearend 2017 would coincide with an exceptionally\nweak stock market. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I felt this possibility (which always exists) was very low. Two factors dictated this\nconclusion: The reasonable price of Berkshire in late 2012, and the large asset build-up that was almost certain to occurat Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate allrisk to the\ncharities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017didn\u2019t produce at least $1 million.\n************\nInvesting is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption\nat a later date. \u201cRisk\u201d is the possibility that this objective won\u2019t be attained.\nBy that standard, purportedly \u201crisk-free\u201d long-term bonds in 2012 were a farriskier investment than a long-\nterm investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 wouldhave decreased the purchasing-power of the government bond that Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I sold.\nI want to quickly acknowledge that in anyupcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier \u2013 far\nriskier \u2013 than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor\u2019s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolioof U.S.", "e that in anyupcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier \u2013 far\nriskier \u2013 than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor\u2019s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolioof U.S. equities becomes progressively lessrisky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible\nmultiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.\nIt is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons \u2013 among them, pension funds, college\nendowments and savings-minded individuals \u2013 to measure their investment \u201crisk\u201d by their portfolio\u2019s ratio of bondsto stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\n************\nA final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, \u201ceasy\u201d decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet,\nthe 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and selldecisions. Most of those managers undoubtedly thought hard about their decisions, each of which they believed wouldprove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journalsand conferred with Wall Street analysts.\n13\n\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9 and I, meanwhile, leaning neither on research, insights nor brilliance, made only one investment\ndecision during the ten years. We simply decided to sell our bond investment at a price of more than 100 times earnings(95.7 sale price/.88 yield), those being \u201cearnings\u201d that could not increase during the ensuing five years.\nWe made the sale in order to move our money into a single security \u2013 Berkshire \u2013 that, in turn, owned a\ndiversified group of solid businesses. Fueled by retained earnings, Berkshire\u2019s growth in value was unlikely to be lessthan 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.\nAfter that kindergarten-like analysis, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%\nwas certain to beat .88%.", "n 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.\nAfter that kindergarten-like analysis, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%\nwas certain to beat .88%.

Help us set another record.\nA GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\u2019s top counselors from\naround the country. At last year\u2019s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 43% from 2016.\nSo stop by for a quote.

Sincewhat we will be conducting is a shareholders\u2019 meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions\nthat add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\nfor sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\u2019t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came andfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.\nAll told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\n18 from the audience. After the 54\nth, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than\n60 by 3:30.\nThe questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m.\non the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room willhost, so to speak, a drawing.\nWhile I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, shouldalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That\u2019s why we try toissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (aday that also eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,\ntreating them instead as we do all other shareholders.", "eases traffic and parking problems).\nWe do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,\ntreating them instead as we do all other shareholders.

They are truly All-Stars\nwho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work.

They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smotheredin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help at the annual meeting in whateverway they are needed.

In all other respects, the results are calculated u sing the\nnumbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax .

The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from animpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realizedcapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion lossfrom a reduction in the amount of unrealized\ncapital gains that existed in our investment holdings.\nA new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,\nneither Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us haveconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as \u201cwild andcapricious swings in our bottom line.\u201d\nThe accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth\nquarters, we reported GAAP losses of $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, we\nreported profits of $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses that\nBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in allquarters. For the year, those earnings\nexceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.\nWide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That\u2019s because our huge equity\nportfolio \u2013 valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 \u2013 will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line.", "alued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 \u2013 will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourthquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201closs\u201d of more than$4 billion.\nOur advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying\nthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them todeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing.\n************\nLong-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. For\nnearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire\u2019s per-share book value. It\u2019snow time to abandon that practice.\nThe fact is that the annual change in Berkshire\u2019s book value \u2013 which makes its farewell appearance on page\n2 \u2013 is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire hasgradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major valueresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, whileourequity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be\nincluded in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, itis likely that \u2013 over time \u2013 Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down.", "atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causesthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.\n3\n\nIn future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire\u2019s market price. Markets can be\nextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire\u2019s stock pricewill provide the best measure of business performance.\n************\nBefore moving on, I want to give you some good news \u2013 really good news \u2013 that is not reflected in our\nfinancial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in chargeof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.\nNow let\u2019s take a look at what you own.\nFocus on the Forest \u2013 Forget the Trees\nInvestors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses \u2013 our\neconomic \u201ctrees,\u201d so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array ofspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade fromnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.\nFortunately, it\u2019s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire\u2019s\nintrinsic business value. That\u2019s because our forest contains five \u201cgroves\u201d of major importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand.", "r importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth \u2013 our huge and diverse insurance operation \u2013 delivers great valueto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.\nBefore we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment\nof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part , that possess favorable and durable economic\ncharacteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.\nSometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes we\nseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach tohuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.\nIn recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for\nour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43billion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in whichwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.\nDespite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire\u2019s forest remains the\nmany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with lessthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year.", "hire\u2019s forest remains the\nmany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with lessthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year. When we say \u201cearned,\u201d moreover, we are describing whatremains after allincome taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based),\nrestructuring expenses, depreciation, amortization and home-office overhead.\nThat brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs.\nToo often, their presentations feature \u201cadjusted EBITDA,\u201d a measure that redefines \u201cearnings\u201d to exclude a variety ofall-too-real costs.\n4\n\nFor example, managements sometimes assert that their company\u2019s stock-based compensation shouldn\u2019t be\ncounted as an expense. (What else could it be \u2013 a giftfrom shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe\nlast year\u2019s exact rearrangement won\u2019t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business \u2013Berkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.\nAbraham Lincoln once posed the question: \u201cIf you call a dog\u2019s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?\u201d and\nthen answered his own query: \u201cFour, because calling a tail a leg doesn\u2019t make it one.\u201d Abe would have felt lonely onWall Street.\nCharlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on page\nK-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization \u201ccosts\u201d to GAAP earnings when we are evaluatingboth private businesses and marketable stocks.\nIn contrast, Berkshire\u2019s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we need\nto spend more than this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those\n\u201cmaintenance\u201d capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth.", ".

Overall, Berkshire invested a record$14.5 billion last year in plant, equipment and other fixed assets, with 89% of that spent in America.\nBerkshire\u2019s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownership\nposition in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at yearend,an amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation, federal income tax of about$14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.Eventually, however, gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.\nOur investees paid us dividends of $3.8 billion last year, a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more important\nthan the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies. Consider, as anindicator, these figures that cover only our five largest holdings.\nYearend\nOwnership\nBerkshire\u2019s Share in $ millions of\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 17.9% $ 237 $ 997\nApple 5.4% 745 2,502Bank of America 9.5% 551 2,096Coca-Cola 9.4% 624 (21)Wells Fargo 9.8% 809 1,263\nTotal $2,966 $6,837\n(1) Based on current annual rate.(2) Based on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\nGAAP \u2013 which dictates the earnings we report \u2013 does not allow us to include the retained earnings of\ninvestees in our financial accounts.", "d on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\nGAAP \u2013 which dictates the earnings we report \u2013 does not allow us to include the retained earnings of\ninvestees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retainedby our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than onedollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.\nAll of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings to\nrepurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee\u2019s stock is underpriced, we rejoicewhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire\u2019s ownership percentage.\n5\n\nHere\u2019s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire\u2019s holdings of American Express have remained\nunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because ofrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire\u2019s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and sharesoutstanding decrease, owners \u2013 over time \u2013 usually do well.\nA third category of Berkshire\u2019s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control with\nother parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses \u2013 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% ofBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J \u2013 totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.\nIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments.", "$1.3 billion in 2018.\nIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to beuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.We have also promised to avoid anyactivities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.\nBerkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of\ncommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, ourstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.\nIn the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will\npermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businessespossessing decent long-term prospects.\nThat disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable\nequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 \u2013 I\u2019m the\nyoung one \u2013 that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie\u2019s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a\nhuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)\nMy expectation of more stock purchases is nota market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will\nbehave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities.", "ctation of more stock purchases is nota market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will\nbehave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather,\nis focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price.\n************\nI believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value can be approximate d by summing the values of our four asset-laden\ngroves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.\nYou may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur if\nwe were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any ofour wonderful companies even if notax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard to\nfind. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.\nThe interest cost on allof our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire\u2019s\nnon-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generatedfrom Berkshire\u2019s fifth grove \u2013 a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds \u201cfloat,\u201d a sourceof financing that we expect to be cost-free \u2013 or maybe even better than that \u2013 over time. We will explain thecharacteristics of float later in this letter.\nFinally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire\u2019s value is maximized by our having assembled the\nfive groves into a single entity.", "explain thecharacteristics of float later in this letter.\nFinally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire\u2019s value is maximized by our having assembled the\nfive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts ofcapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantageof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.\nAt Berkshire, the whole is greater \u2013 considerably greater \u2013 than the sum of the parts.\n6\n\nRepurchases and Reporting\nEarlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that we\nbuy at a discount to Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value \u2013 which certainly will be our intention \u2013 repurchases will benefit boththose shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.\nTrue, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That\u2019s because careful buying by\nus will minimize any impact on Berkshire\u2019s stock price. Nevertheless, there is some benefit to sellers in having an\nextra buyer in the market.\nFor continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner\u2019s interest at,\nsay, 90\u00a2 on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase bythe company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.\nWhen a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it\u2019s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report.", "chases, it\u2019s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled orinadequately informed.\nSome sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments\nthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There areunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.\nIn addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it\u2019s time for them or their families to become net\nconsumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhapswe will become big spenders in our old age.\n************\nFor 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders\nwho are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have never focused on current-quarter results.\nBerkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports\nor balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and Ilearn of Berkshire\u2019s overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.\nFurthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Our\nlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly \u201cnumber\u201d to hit. Shunning the\nuse of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations.", "e culture we prize.\nOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations.

The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.\n7\n\nNon-Insurance Operations \u2013 From Lollipops to Locomotives\nLet\u2019s now look further at Berkshire\u2019s most valuable grove \u2013 our collection of non-insurance businesses \u2013\nkeeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them.Additional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 \u2013 K-22 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-51.\nViewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over\n2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.\nI will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was\nfargreater \u2013 47 %\u2013 thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of\nthat year. Let\u2019s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\nBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \u201cowns\u201d an interest in Berkshire\u2019s\nearnings of a size determined by Congress.", "at year. Let\u2019s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\nBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \u201cowns\u201d an interest in Berkshire\u2019s\nearnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country\u2019s Treasury Department holds a special class of ourstock \u2013 call this holding the AA shares \u2013 that receives large \u201cdividends\u201d (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very wellwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury\u2019s \u201cstock,\u201d which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolvedinto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.\nLast year, however, 40% of the government\u2019s \u201cownership\u201d (14/35\nths) was returned to Berkshire \u2013 free of\ncharge \u2013 when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d shareholders received amajor boost in the earnings attributable to their shares.\nThis happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same\ndynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.\nThose are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the tax\nbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicableto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate haslong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,the new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerably more valuable.\nWhich suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses.

Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before taxlast year, up 6% from 2017.", "of our non-insurance businesses.

You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 \u2013 K-10 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-45.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018of $6.4 billion, up from the $5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.4\nbillion pre-tax last year, up from $2.1 billion in 2017.\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 had pre-tax income of\n$3.6 billion in 2018 vs. $3.3 billion in 2017.\n8\n\nInsurance, \u201cFloat,\u201d and the Funding of Berkshire\nOur property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurance business \u2013 our fifth grove \u2013 has been the engine propelling\nBerkshire\u2019s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measuredby net worth.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\u2019s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.", "ugh individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume.

If so, the decline will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns ontangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\nNevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire\u2019s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility\nin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are alwaysan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities.", "us far more flexibility\nin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are alwaysan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained, our choices expand.\nMoreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. Forthe entire 16-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27 billion, of which $2 billion was recorded in 2018.\n9\n\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\n************\nIn most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources \u2013 debt and equity. At Berkshire, we have\ntwo additional arrows in the quiver to talk about, but let\u2019s first address the conventional components.\nWe use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that\nsignificant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right most of the time.\nAt rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-\nroulette equation \u2013 usually win, occasionally die \u2013 may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of acompany\u2019s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rationalpeople don\u2019t risk what they have and need for what they don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need.\nMost of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet \u2013 see page K-65 \u2013 resides at our railroad and\nenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businessesremains bountiful.", "dated balance sheet \u2013 see page K-65 \u2013 resides at our railroad and\nenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businessesremains bountiful. The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and notguaranteed by Berkshire.\nOur level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire\u2019s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America. By\nretaining all earnings for a very long time, and allowing compound interest to work its magic, we have amassed fundsthat have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100%payout policy, we would still be working with the $22 million with which we began fiscal 1965.\nBeyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of\ncorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge netliability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That\u2019s because they\nhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paid in most years for holding and\nusing other people\u2019s money.\nAs I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in\nassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe thatwill dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur \u2013 perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \u201cThe\nBig One\u201d may come from a traditional source, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving,say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate.

When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, we will get our share of the losses and they will be big \u2013 very big. Unlike many other insurers,\nhowever, we will be looking to add business the next day.\nThe final funding source \u2013 which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree \u2013 is deferred income taxes.\nThese are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest-free.\nAs I indicated earlier, about $14.7 billion of our $50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealized\ngains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate taxrate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold. Between now and then, we in effect havean interest-free \u201cloan\u201d that allows us to have more money working for us in equities than would otherwise be the case.\n10\n\nA further $28.3 billion of deferred tax results from our being able to accelerate the depreciation of assets such\nas plant and equipment in calculating the tax we must currently pay. The front-ended savings in taxes that we recordgradually reverse in future years. We regularly purchase additional assets, however. As long as the present tax lawprevails, this source of funding should trend upward.\nOver time, Berkshire\u2019s funding base \u2013 that\u2019s the right-hand side of our balance sheet \u2013 should grow, primarily\nthrough the earnings we retain. Our job is to put the money retained to good use on the left-hand side, by addingattractive assets.\nGEICO and Tony Nicely\nThat title says it all: The company and the man are inseparable.Tony joined GEICO in 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970s.

At that time, GEICO, after a four-\ndecade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. Arecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO\u2019s loss costs and consequently underpriced itsproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO\u2019s books \u2013 there were no less than2.3 million of them \u2013 would expire and could then be repriced. The company\u2019s net worth in the meantime was rapidlyapproaching zero.\nIn 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concluded\nthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshirebought about\n1\u20443of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly1\u20442without our spending a dime. That stunning\naccretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this half-interest in GEICO cost Berkshire $47 million, about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.\nLet\u2019s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO\u2019s\nreputation and profitability had been restored \u2013 but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9million auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICOthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.\nLate in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the\ncompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!).", "ter Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the\ncompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!).

Over time, however, investment performanceconverges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has beenextraordinary.\nThe American Tailwind\nOn March 11\nth, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was\n11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six.

The year was 1942, I was\n11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of CitiesService preferred stock. I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.\nLet\u2019s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in\n1788, a year prior to George Washington\u2019s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined whattheir new country would accomplish in only three 77-year lifetimes?\nDuring the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people \u2013 about\n1\u20442of 1% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 into the most powerful country on earth. In that spring of 1942, though, it faced\na crisis: The U.S. and its allies were suffering heavy losses in a war that we had entered only three months earlier. Badnews arrived daily.\nDespite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11\nththat the war would be\nwon. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed thattheir children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led.\nThe nation\u2019s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride. It never had\nbeen. Early in its history our country was tested by a Civil War that killed 4% of all American males and led PresidentLincoln to openly ponder whether \u201ca nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure.\u201d In the 1930s, Americasuffered through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.\nNevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved\nto be well-founded.", "through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.\nNevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved\nto be well-founded. In fact, the nation\u2019s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.\nLet\u2019s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and all\ndividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (thelatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment\nby a tax-free institution of that time \u2013 say, a pension fund or college endowment \u2013 would have grown to about $5.3billion .\nLet me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid\nonly 1%of assets annually to various \u201chelpers,\u201d such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have\nbeen cut in half , to $2.65 billion. That\u2019s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved\nby the S&P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.\n13\n\nThose who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many\nyears) might note that our country\u2019s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.That\u2019s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and aworthless currency. To \u201cprotect\u201d yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 3\n1\u20444ounces of\ngold with your $114.75.\nAnd what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,\nless than 1% of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business.

The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capitalgains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.\nThat $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requires\na company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealized gains and losses of those\nsecurities. As we stated in last year\u2019s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agreewith that rule.\nThe adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.\nBefore 2018, GAAP insisted \u2013 with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities \u2013 thatunrealized gains within a portfolio of stocks were never to be included in earnings and unrealized losses were to be\nincluded only if they were deemed \u201cother than temporary.\u201d Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter\u2019s bottom\nline \u2013 a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators \u2013 every up and down movement of the stocksit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.\nBerkshire\u2019s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a down\nyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreased by $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP\nearnings of only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7\nbillion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter.", "only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7\nbillion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrationsled to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!\nMeanwhile, in what we might call the real world, as opposed to accounting-land, Berkshire\u2019s equity holdings\naveraged about $200 billion during the two years, and the intrinsic value of the stocks we own grew steadily and\nsubstantially throughout the period.\nCharlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings \u2013 which were little changed in 2019 \u2013 and to ignore\nboth quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized.\nOur advising that in no way diminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie\nand I expect our equity holdings \u2013 as a group \u2013 to deliver major gains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular\nmanner. To see why we are optimistic, move on to the next discussion.\nThe Power of Retained Earnings\nIn 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long\nTerm Investments , a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,\nforcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.\nGoing in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods and\nthat bonds would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was infor a shock.\n3\n\nHis book began, therefore, with a confession: \u201cThese studies are the record of a failure \u2013 the failure of facts\nto sustain a preconceived theory.\u201d Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocksshould be evaluated.\nFor the crux of Smith\u2019s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard\nKeynes: \u201cI have kept until last what is perhaps Mr.", "eply about how stocksshould be evaluated.\nFor the crux of Smith\u2019s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard\nKeynes: \u201cI have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith\u2019s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is\nan element of compound interest (Keynes\u2019 italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a period\nof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from thedividends paid out to the shareholders.\u201d\nAnd with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.It\u2019s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith\u2019s book was\npublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,Rockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produceever-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich followingthe same playbook.\nNevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces \u2013 \u201cstocks\u201d \u2013 buyers in the pre-Smith\nyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks wereconsidered speculations. Gentlemen preferred bonds.\nThough investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now well\nunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed \u201cnovel\u201d: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders.\n************\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously.", "children learn what Keynes termed \u201cnovel\u201d: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders.\n************\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously. Sometimes this\njob has been easy \u2013 at other times, more than difficult, particularly when we began working with huge and ever-growing sums of money.\nIn our deployment of the funds we retain, we first seek to invest in the many and diverse businesses we\nalready own. During the past decade, Berkshire\u2019s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas thecompany\u2019s internal investments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment in\nproductive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.\nIn addition, we constantly seek to buy new businesses that meet three criteria. First, they must earn good\nreturns on the net tangible capital required in their operation. Second, they must be run by able and honest managers.Finally, they must be available at a sensible price.\nWhen we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to make\nmajor acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare. Far more often, a fickle stock market serves upopportunities for us to buy large, but non-controlling , positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.\nWhichever way we go \u2013 controlled companies or only a major stake by way of the stock market \u2013 Berkshire\u2019s\nfinancial results from the commitment will in large part be determined by the future earnings of the business we havepurchased. Nonetheless, there is between the two investment approaches a hugely important accounting difference,essential for you to understand.\n4\n\nIn our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), the\nearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you.", "4\n\nIn our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), the\nearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you. What you see is what youget.\nIn the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, only the dividends that Berkshire\nreceives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They\u2019re working hard and creatingmuch added value, but notin a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire\u2019s reported earnings.\nAt almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would notfind what we\u2019ll call this \u201cnon-\nrecognition of earnings\u201d important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for youbelow.\nHere, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earnings\nthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting \u2013 these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees\u2013 and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies useretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchasesignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire\u2019s share of the company\u2019s future earnings.\nYearend\nOwnership\nBerkshire\u2019s Share (in millions)\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 18.7% $ 261 $ 998\nApple 5.7% 773 2,519Bank of America 10.7% 682 2,167Bank of New York Mellon 9.0% 101 288Coca-Cola 9.3% 640 194Delta Airlines 11.0% 114 416J.P.

Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But bothlogic and our past experience indicate that from the group we will realize capital gains at least equal to \u2013 and probably\nbetter than \u2013 the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax onthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)\nIt is certain that Berkshire\u2019s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equity\nholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimescompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times \u2013 last year was one of those \u2013 our gainwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of major importance in the growth of\nBerkshire\u2019s value.\nMr. Smith got it right.\n5\n\nNon-Insurance Operations\nTom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gave\nme some important advice about acquisitions: \u201cTo achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy goodbusinesses.\u201d\nOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as \u201cgood\nbusinesses.\u201d Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters.", "\u201d\nOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as \u201cgood\nbusinesses.\u201d Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, onthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.\nIn reviewing my uneven record, I\u2019ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,\nwith a joyful wedding \u2013 but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, thenew union delivers bliss beyond either party\u2019s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those imagesto corporate acquisitions, I\u2019d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It\u2019s easy to getdreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.\nPursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy\nwith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,however, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.\nFortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by most\nbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the \u201cpoor\u201d business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in whichits operations require an ever-smaller percentage of Berkshire\u2019s capital. Meanwhile, our \u201cgood\u201d businesses often tend\nto grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrastingtrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire\u2019s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.\nAs an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire\u2019s original textile business. When\nwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire\u2019s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire\u2019s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns.", "company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire\u2019s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire\u2019s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,though, we acquired a spread of \u201cgood\u201d businesses, a shift that by the early 1980s caused the dwindling textileoperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.\nToday, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returns\non the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operationhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. Wewill save that discussion for the next section.\nIn the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after\ninterest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges \u2013 all of those pesky, but very real, coststhat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore.", "of earnings, after\ninterest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges \u2013 all of those pesky, but very real, coststhat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore. Additional information about these operations can befound on pages K-6 \u2013 K-21 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-52.\nOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) \u2013 the two lead dogs of Berkshire\u2019s non-\ninsurance group \u2013 earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%from 2018.\nOur next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.\nThe next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, NetJets, Shaw\nand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.\n6\n\nThe remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 had aggregate earnings\nof $2.7 billion in 2019, down from $2.8 billion in 2018.\nOur total net income in 2019 from the non-insurance businesses we control amounted to $17.7 billion, an\nincrease of 3% from the $17.2 billion this group earned in 2018. Acquisitions and dispositions had almost no net effecton these results.\n************\nI must add one final item that underscores the wide scope of Berkshire\u2019s operations. Since 2011, we have\nowned Lubrizol, an Ohio-based company that produces and markets oil additives throughout the world. On September26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.\nThe result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol\u2019s business.", "26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.\nThe result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol\u2019s business. Even so, both the\ncompany\u2019s property loss and business-interruption loss will be mitigated by substantial insurance recoveries thatLubrizol will receive.\nBut, as the late Paul Harvey was given to saying in his famed radio broadcasts, \u201cHere\u2019s the rest of the story.\u201d\nOne of the largest insurers of Lubrizol was a company owned b y...u h , Berkshire.\nIn Matthew 6:3, the Bible instructs us to \u201cLet not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.\u201d Your\nchairman has clearly behaved as ordered.\nProperty/Casualty Insurance\nOur property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire\u2019s growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company in the world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a businessof promises, and Berkshire\u2019s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\u2019s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.", "ugh individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following\ntable shows:\nYear\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,7322019 129,423\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \u2013 at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\n7\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money \u2013 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\nFor the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That\u2019s\nbecause the standard investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily \u2013 and properly \u2013 skewed toward\nhigh-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decadethe bond market has offered pathetically low rates.\nConsequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced \u2013 by maturities or issuer-call provisions \u2013\nto recycle their \u201cold\u201d investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields.", "nsequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced \u2013 by maturities or issuer-call provisions \u2013\nto recycle their \u201cold\u201d investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurerscould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less iftheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).\nSome insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid\n\u201calternative\u201d investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutionsare ill-equipped to play.\nBerkshire\u2019s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled\nmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far moreinvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us arealways advantageous \u2013 and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.\nOur P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\nAs I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years.", "I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.\nMistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years \u2013 even decades \u2013 to surface and\nripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur \u2013 perhaps\ntomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \u201cThe Big One\u201d may come from a traditional source, such as wind orearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anythinginsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and theywill be big \u2013 very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our\nresources, and we will be eager to addto our business the next day.\n** **********\nClose your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. New\nYork? London? Silicon Valley?\nHow about Wilkes-Barre?\n8\n\nLate in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he was\nbuying a tiny company \u2013 GUARD Insurance Group \u2013 in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its networth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD\u2019s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD andSy were new names to me.\nBingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and also\ndelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new productsand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD\u2019s float by 265%.\nIn 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20\nthyear under our ownership.", "an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20\nthyear under our ownership. That anniversary suggests\nthat we should be catching up with the company\u2019s accomplishments.\nWe\u2019ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing\n76% of BHE, the company\u2019s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).Prices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no baserate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here\u2019s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:Last year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE\u2019s. Recently, that utility received arate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.\nThe extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishments\nin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE\u2019s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hoursof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover theannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attainedwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.\nIn still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,\nwe know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of windself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customersare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE\u2019s ability to deliverrenewable, low-cost energy.\nOf course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time.", "their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE\u2019s ability to deliverrenewable, low-cost energy.\nOf course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time. In certain periods, when\nthe air is still, we look to our non-wind generating capacity to secure the electricity we need. At opposite times, wesell the excess power that wind provides us to other utilities, serving them through what\u2019s called \u201cthe grid.\u201d The powerwe sell them supplants their need for a carbon resource \u2013 coal, say, or natural gas.\nBerkshire Hathaway now owns 91% of BHE in partnership with Walter Scott, Jr. and Greg Abel. BHE has\nnever paid Berkshire Hathaway a dividend since our purchase and has, as the years have passed, retained $28 billionof earnings. That pattern is an outlier in the world of utilities, whose companies customarily pay big dividends \u2013sometimes reaching, or even exceeding, 80% of earnings. Our view: The more we can invest, the more we like it.\nToday, BHE has the operating talent and experience to manage truly huge utility projects \u2013 requiring\ninvestments of $100 billion or more \u2013 that could support infrastructure benefitting our country, our communities andour shareholders. We stand ready, willing and able to take on such opportunities.\n9\n\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We exclude\nour Kraft Heinz holding \u2013 325,442,152 shares \u2013 because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the \u201cequity\u201d method.

Second,Berkshire\u2019s positioning of its \u201ccontrolled\u201d businesses within a single entity endows it with some important andenduring economic advantages. Third, Berkshire\u2019s financial affairs will unfailingly be managed in a manner allowingthe company to withstand external shocks of an extreme nature. Fourth, we possess skilled and devoted top managers\nfor whom running Berkshire is far more than simply having a high-paying and/or prestigious job.

I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so. My only disposalof Berkshire shares, aside from charitable donations and minor personal gifts, took place in 1980, when I, along withother Berkshire stockholders who elected to participate, exchanged some of our Berkshire shares for the shares of anIllinois bank that Berkshire had purchased in 1969 and that, in 1980, needed to be offloaded because of changes in thebank holding company law.\nToday, my will specifically directs its executors \u2013 as well as the trustees who will succeed them in\nadministering my estate after the will is closed \u2013 not to sell anyBerkshire shares.", "g company law.\nToday, my will specifically directs its executors \u2013 as well as the trustees who will succeed them in\nadministering my estate after the will is closed \u2013 not to sell anyBerkshire shares. My will also absolves both the\nexecutors and the trustees from liability for maintaining what obviously will be an extreme concentration of assets.\nThe will goes on to instruct the executors \u2013 and, in time, the trustees \u2013 to each year convert a portion of my\nA shares into B shares and then distribute the Bs to various foundations. Those foundations will be required to deploytheir grants promptly. In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold atmy death to move into the market.\nAbsent my will\u2019s directive that all my Berkshire shares should be held until their scheduled distribution dates,\nthe \u201csafe\u201d course for both my executors and trustees would be to sell the Berkshire shares under their temporarycontrol and reinvest the proceeds in U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities matching the scheduled dates fordistributions. That strategy would leave the fiduciaries immune from both public criticism and the possibility ofpersonal liability for failure to act in accordance with the \u201cprudent man\u201d standard.\n11\n\nI myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during the\ndisposal period. There is always a chance \u2013 unlikely, but not negligible \u2013 that events will prove me wrong. I believe,however, that there is a high probability that my directive will deliver substantially greater resources to society thanwould result from a conventional course of action.\nKey to my \u201cBerkshire-only\u201d instructions is my faith in the future judgment and fidelity of Berkshire directors.\nThey will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees.

At many companies, these super-salesmen might win. Ido not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.\nBoards of Directors\nIn recent years, both the composition of corporate boards and their purpose have become hot topics. Once,\ndebate about the responsibilities of boards was largely limited to lawyers; today, institutional investors and politicianshave weighed in as well.\nMy credentials for discussing corporate governance include the fact that, over the last 62 years, I have served\nas a director of 21 publicly-owned companies (listed below). In all but two of them, I have represented a substantialholding of stock. In a few cases, I have tried to implement important change.\nDuring the first 30 or so years of my services, it was rare to find a woman in the room unless she represented\na family controlling the enterprise. This year, it should be noted, marks the 100\nthanniversary of the 19thAmendment,\nwhich guaranteed American women the right to have their voices heard in a voting booth. Their attaining similar statusin a board room remains a work in progress.\nOver the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come into\nbeing. The bedrock challenge for directors, nevertheless, remains constant: Find and retain a talented CEO \u2013possessing integrity, for sure \u2013 who will be devoted to the company for his/her business lifetime. Often, that task is\nhard. When directors get it right, though, they need to do little else. But when they mess it up ,......\nAudit committees now work much harder than they once did and almost always view the job with appropriate\nseriousness.", "t it right, though, they need to do little else. But when they mess it up ,......\nAudit committees now work much harder than they once did and almost always view the job with appropriate\nseriousness. Nevertheless, these committees remain no match for managers who wish to game numbers, an offensethat has been encouraged by the scourge of earnings \u201cguidance\u201d and the desire of CEOs to \u201chit the number.\u201d My directexperience (limited, thankfully) with CEOs who have played with a company\u2019s numbers indicates that they were moreoften prompted by ego than by a desire for financial gain.\nCompensation committees now rely much more heavily on consultants than they used to. Consequently,\ncompensation arrangements have become more complicated \u2013 what committee member wants to explain paying largefees year after year for a simple plan? \u2013 and the reading of proxy material has become a mind-numbing experience.\nOne very important improvement in corporate governance has been mandated: a regularly-scheduled\n\u201cexecutive session\u201d of directors at which the CEO is barred. Prior to that change, truly frank discussions of a CEO\u2019sskills, acquisition decisions and compensation were rare.\nAcquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members.

Don\u2019t hold your breath awaiting this reform: The current system, whatever its shortcomings for shareholders,works magnificently for CEOs and the many advisors and other professionals who feast on deals. A venerable cautionwill forever be true when advice from Wall Street is contemplated: Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.\nOver the years, board \u201cindependence\u201d has become a new area of emphasis. One key point relating to this\ntopic, though, is almost invariably overlooked: Director compensation has now soared to a level that inevitably makespay a subconscious factor affecting the behavior of many non-wealthy members. Think, for a moment, of the directorearning $250,000-300,000 for board meetings consuming a pleasant couple of days six or so times a year. Frequently,the possession of one such directorship bestows on its holder three to four times the annual median income of U.S.\nhouseholds.

Board members may get politely ignored, but they seldom get fired.\nInstead, generous age limits \u2013 usually 70 or higher \u2013 act as the standard method for the genteel ejection of directors.\nIs it any wonder that a non-wealthy director (\u201cNWD\u201d) now hopes \u2013 or even yearns \u2013 to be asked to join a\nsecond board, thereby vaulting into the $500,000-600,000 class? To achieve this goal, the NWD will need help. TheCEO of a company searching for board members will almost certainly check with the NWD\u2019s current CEO as towhether NWD is a \u201cgood\u201d director. \u201cGood,\u201d of course, is a code word.

Not long ago, I looked at the proxy material of a large Americancompany and found that eight directors had never purchased a share of the company\u2019s stock using their own money .\n(They, of course, had received grants of stock as a supplement to their generous cash compensation.) This particular\ncompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.\nPaid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does notcreate wisdom or ensure business smarts.\nNevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shareswith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants.\n************\nHere, a pause is due: I\u2019d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been\ndecent, likable and intelligent.

Our thinking, boiled down:\nBerkshire will buy back its stock only if a) Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth and b) thecompany, upon completing the repurchase, is left with ample cash.\nCalculations of intrinsic value are far from precise. Consequently, neither of us feels any urgency to buy an\nestimated $1 of value for a very real 95 cents. In 2019, the Berkshire price/value equation was modestly favorable at\ntimes, and we spent $5 billion in repurchasing about 1% of the company.\nOver time, we want Berkshire\u2019s share count to go down . If the price-to-value discount (as we estimate it)\nwidens, we will likely become more aggressive in purchasing shares.

The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings, $4.9 billion of realizedcapital gains, a $26.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold and, finally, an $11 billion lossfrom a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businesses\nthat we own. All items are stated on an after-tax basis.\nOperating earnings are what count most, even during periods when they are notthe largest item in our GAAP\ntotal. Our focus at Berkshire is both to increase this segment of our income and to acquire large and favorably-situatedbusinesses. Last year, however, we met neither goal: Berkshire made no sizable acquisitions and operating earningsfell9%. We did, though, increase Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value by both retaining earnings and repurchasing\nabout 5% of our shares.\nThe two GAAP components pertaining to capital gains or losses (whether realized or unrealized) fluctuate\ncapriciously from year to year, reflecting swings in the stock market. Whatever today\u2019s figures, Charlie Munger, my\nlong-time partner, and I firmly believe that, over time, Berkshire\u2019s capital gains from its investment holdings will besubstantial.\nAs I\u2019ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire\u2019s holdings of marketable stocks \u2013 at yearend\nworth $281 billion \u2013 as a collection of businesses .", "s investment holdings will besubstantial.\nAs I\u2019ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire\u2019s holdings of marketable stocks \u2013 at yearend\nworth $281 billion \u2013 as a collection of businesses . We don\u2019t control the operations of those companies, but we do\nshare proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of theirearnings isnotincluded in Berkshire\u2019s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded on\nour books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible.\nWhat\u2019s out of sight, however, should notbe out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually\nbuilding value \u2013 lotsof value \u2013 for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make\nacquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout ourcountry\u2019s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions ofshareholders as well.\nOf course, some of our investees will disappoint, adding little, if anything, to the value of their company by\nretaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the hugepile of earnings retained by Berkshire\u2019s non-controlled businesses (what others would label our equity portfolio) toeventually deliver us an equal or greater amount of capital gains. Over our 56-year tenure, that expectation has beenmet.\n3\n\nThe final component in our GAAP figure \u2013 that ugly $11 billion write-down \u2013 is almost entirely the\nquantification of a mistake I made in 2016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts (\u201cPCC\u201d), and I paidtoo much for the company.\nNo one misled me in any way \u2013 I was simply too optimistic about PCC\u2019s normalized profit potential.", "016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts (\u201cPCC\u201d), and I paidtoo much for the company.\nNo one misled me in any way \u2013 I was simply too optimistic about PCC\u2019s normalized profit potential. Last\nyear, my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry, PCC\u2019s mostimportant source of customers.\nIn purchasing PCC, Berkshire bought a fine company \u2013 the best in its business. Mark Donegan, PCC\u2019s CEO,\nis a passionate manager who consistently pours the same energy into the business that he did before we purchased it.We are lucky to have him running things.\nI believe I was right in concluding that PCC would, over time, earn good returns on the net tangible assets\ndeployed in its operations. I was wrong, however, in judging the average amount of future earnings and, consequently,\nwrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business.\nPCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it\u2019s a big one.\nTwo Strings to Our Bow\nBerkshire is often labeled a conglomerate, a negative term applied to holding companies that own a\nhodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And, yes, that describes Berkshire \u2013 but only in part. To understand how andwhy we differ from the prototype conglomerate, let\u2019s review a little history.\nOver time, conglomerates have generally limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety . That\nstrategy, however, came with two major problems. One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had nointerest in having anyone take them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-so\ncompanies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish.\nBeyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often found\nthemselves required to pay staggering \u201ccontrol\u201d premiums to snare their quarry.", "nd in which to fish.\nBeyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often found\nthemselves required to pay staggering \u201ccontrol\u201d premiums to snare their quarry. Aspiring conglomerateurs knew theanswer to this \u201coverpayment\u201d problem: They simply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stock of their ownthat could be used as a \u201ccurrency\u201d for pricey acquisitions. (\u201cI\u2019ll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two ofmy $5,000 cats.\u201d)\nOften, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate\u2019s stock involved promotional techniques\nand \u201cimaginative\u201d accounting maneuvers that were, at best, deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud.When these tricks were \u201csuccessful,\u201d the conglomerate pushed its own stock to, say, 3x its business value in order tooffer the target 2x itsvalue.\nInvesting illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-making\ngenerates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of apromoted stock can itself become the \u201cproof\u201d that an illusion is reality.\n4\n\nEventually, of course, the party ends, and many business \u201cemperors\u201d are found to have no clothes. Financial\nhistory is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses byjournalists, analysts and investment bankers, but whose creations ended up as business junkyards.\nConglomerates earned their terrible reputation.\n************\nCharlie and I want our conglomerate to ownall or part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic\ncharacteristics and good managers. Whether Berkshire controls these businesses, however, is unimportant to us.\nIt took me a while to wise up.", "part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic\ncharacteristics and good managers. Whether Berkshire controls these businesses, however, is unimportant to us.\nIt took me a while to wise up. But Charlie \u2013 and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inherited\nat Berkshire \u2013 finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable,more enjoyable and farless work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise.\nFor those reasons, ourconglomerate will remain a collection of controlled andnon-controlled businesses.\nCharlie and I will simply deploy your capital into whatever we believe makes the most sense, based on a company\u2019sdurable competitive strengths, the capabilities and character of its management, and price.\nIf that strategy requires little or no effort on our part, so much the better.

All four are jewels.\nThe largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation, which for 53 years has been the core of\nBerkshire. Our family of insurers is unique in the insurance field. So, too, is its manager, Ajit Jain, who joinedBerkshire in 1986.\nOverall, the insurance fleet operates with farmore capital than is deployed by any of its competitors\nworldwide. That financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cash Berkshire annually receives from its\nnon-insurance businesses, allows our insurance companies to safely follow an equity-heavy investment strategy not\nfeasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons,must focus on bonds.\nAnd bonds are not the place to be these days. Can you believe that the income recently available from a\n10-year U.S. Treasury bond \u2013 the yield was 0.93% at yearend \u2013 had fallen 94% from the 15.8% yield available in\nSeptember 1981? In certain large and important countries, such as Germany and Japan, investors earn a negative return\non trillions of dollars of sovereign debt. Fixed-income investors worldwide \u2013 whether pension funds, insurancecompanies or retirees \u2013 face a bleak future.\n5\n\nSome insurers, as well as other bond investors, may try to juice the pathetic returns now available by shifting\ntheir purchases to obligations backed by shaky borrowers.

Andin the fourth spot is our 91% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d). What we have here is a very unusualutility business, whose annual earnings have grown from $122 million to $3.4 billion during our 21 years of ownership.\nI\u2019ll have more to say about BNSF and BHE later in this letter. For now, however, I would like to focus on a\npractice Berkshire will periodically use to enhance your interest in both its \u201cBig Four\u201d as well as the many other assets\nBerkshire owns.\n************\nLast year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire\u2019s spread of properties by repurchasing the\nequivalent of 80,998 \u201cA\u201d shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process.", "Berkshire owns.\n************\nLast year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire\u2019s spread of properties by repurchasing the\nequivalent of 80,998 \u201cA\u201d shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased your ownership in allof\nBerkshire\u2019s businesses by 5.2% without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet.\nFollowing criteria Charlie and I have long recommended, we made those purchases because we believed they\nwould both enhance the intrinsic value per share for continuing shareholders andwould leave Berkshire with more\nthan ample funds for any opportunities or problems it might encounter.\nIn no way do we think that Berkshire shares should be repurchased at simply any price. I emphasize that\npoint because American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases whenprices have risen than when they have tanked. Our approach is exactly the reverse.\nBerkshire\u2019s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock\nlate in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that,I\u2019m referencing the investment held in Berkshire\u2019s general account and am excluding a very small andseparately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases inmid-2018, Berkshire\u2019s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.\nOur cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about\n$775 million annually, and have also \u2013 in 2020 \u2013 pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of ourposition.\nDespite that sale \u2013 voila! \u2013 Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming\nabout because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now hasoutstanding.\n6\n\nBut that\u2019s far from all of the good news.", "was costless to us, coming\nabout because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now hasoutstanding.\n6\n\nBut that\u2019s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21\u20442years,\nyounow indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple\u2019s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.\nThis agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to\nfurther reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. Asthese reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSFand BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.\nThe math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple way\nfor investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.\nAnd as a sultry Mae West assured us: \u201cToo much of a good thing can be . . . wonderful.\u201d\nInvestments\nBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend were our largest in market value. We\nexclude our Kraft Heinz holding \u2014 325,442,152 shares \u2014 because Berkshire is part of a control group and thereforemust account for that investment using the \u201cequity\u201d method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinzholding at a GAAP figure of $13.3 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire\u2019s share of the audited net worth ofKraft Heinz on December 31, 2020.

Since our country\u2019s birth, individuals with an idea, ambition\nand often just a pittance of capital have succeeded beyond their dreams by creating something new or by improvingthe customer\u2019s experience with something old.\nCharlie and I journeyed throughout the nation to join with many of these individuals or their families. On the\nWest Coast, we began the routine in 1972 with our purchase of See\u2019s Candy.", "omething old.\nCharlie and I journeyed throughout the nation to join with many of these individuals or their families. On the\nWest Coast, we began the routine in 1972 with our purchase of See\u2019s Candy. A full century ago, Mary See set out todeliver an age-old product that she had reinvented with special recipes. Added to her business plan were quaint storesstaffed by friendly salespeople. Her first small outlet in Los Angeles eventually led to several hundred shops, spreadthroughout the West.\nToday, Mrs. See\u2019s creations continue to delight customers while providing life-long employment for\nthousands of women and men. Berkshire\u2019s job is simply not to meddle with the company\u2019s success. When a businessmanufactures and distributes a non-essential consumer product, the customer is the boss. And, after 100 years, the\ncustomer\u2019s message to Berkshire remains clear: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with mycandy.\u201d (The website is https://www.sees.com/;\ntry the peanut brittle.)\nLet\u2019s move across the continent to Washington, D.C. In 1936, Leo Goodwin, along with his wife, Lillian,\nbecame convinced that auto insurance \u2013 a standardized product customarily purchased from agents \u2013 could be solddirectly at a much lower price. Armed with $100,000, the pair took on giant insurers possessing 1,000 times or moretheir capital. Government Employees Insurance Company (later shortened to GEICO) was on its way.\nBy luck, I was exposed to the company\u2019s potential a full 70 years ago. It instantly became my first love (of\nan investment sort). You know the rest of the story: Berkshire eventually became the 100% owner of GEICO, whichat 84 years of age is constantly fine-tuning \u2013 but not changing \u2013 the vision of Leo and Lillian.\nThere has been, however, a change in the company\u2019s size. In 1937, its first full year of operation, GEICO did\n$238,288 of business.", "tly fine-tuning \u2013 but not changing \u2013 the vision of Leo and Lillian.\nThere has been, however, a change in the company\u2019s size. In 1937, its first full year of operation, GEICO did\n$238,288 of business. Last year the figure was $35 billion.\n************\nToday, with much of finance, media, government and tech located in coastal areas, it\u2019s easy to overlook the\nmany miracles occurring in middle America. Let\u2019s focus on two communities that provide stunning illustrations ofthe talent and ambition existing throughout our country.\nYou will not be surprised that I begin with Omaha.In 1940, Jack Ringwalt, a graduate of Omaha\u2019s Central High School (the alma mater as well of Charlie, my\ndad, my first wife, our three children and two grandchildren), decided to start a property/casualty insurance companyfunded by $125,000 in capital.\nJack\u2019s dream was preposterous, requiring his pipsqueak operation \u2013 somewhat pompously christened as\nNational Indemnity \u2013 to compete with giant insurers, all of which operated with abundant capital. Additionally, thosecompetitors were solidly entrenched with nationwide networks of well-funded and long-established local agents.Under Jack\u2019s plan, National Indemnity, unlike GEICO, would itself use whatever agencies deigned to accept it andconsequently enjoy nocost advantage in its acquisition of business. To overcome those formidable handicaps,\nNational Indemnity focused on \u201codd-ball\u201d risks, which were deemed unimportant by the \u201cbig boys.\u201d And, improbably,the strategy succeeded.\nJack was honest, shrewd, likeable and a bit quirky. In particular, he disliked regulators. When he periodically\nbecame annoyed with their supervision, he would feel an urge to sell his company.\n8\n\nFortunately, I was nearby on one of those occasions. Jack liked the idea of joining Berkshire, and we made a\ndeal in 1967, taking all of 15 minutes to reach a handshake.", "urge to sell his company.\n8\n\nFortunately, I was nearby on one of those occasions. Jack liked the idea of joining Berkshire, and we made a\ndeal in 1967, taking all of 15 minutes to reach a handshake. I never asked for an audit.\nToday National Indemnity is the onlycompany in the world prepared to insure certain giant risks. And, yes,\nit remains based in Omaha, a few miles from Berkshire\u2019s home office.\nOver the years, we have purchased four additional businesses from Omaha families, the best known among\nthem being Nebraska Furniture Mart (\u201cNFM\u201d). The company\u2019s founder, Rose Blumkin (\u201cMrs. B\u201d), arrived in Seattlein 1915 as a Russian emigrant, unable to read or speak English. She settled in Omaha several years later and by 1936had saved $2,500 with which to start a furniture store.\nCompetitors and suppliers ignored her, and for a time their judgment seemed correct: World War II stalled\nher business, and at yearend 1946, the company\u2019s net worth had grown to only $72,264. Cash, both in the till and ondeposit, totaled $50 (that\u2019s not a typo).\nOne invaluable asset, however, went unrecorded in the 1946 figures: Louie Blumkin, Mrs. B\u2019s only son, had\nrejoined the store after four years in the U.S. Army. Louie fought at Normandy\u2019s Omaha Beach following the D-Dayinvasion, earned a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in the Battle of the Bulge, and finally sailed home in November1945.\nOnce Mrs. B and Louie were reunited, there was no stopping NFM. Driven by their dream, mother and son\nworked days, nights and weekends. The result was a retailing miracle.\nBy 1983, the pair had created a business worth $60 million. That year, on my birthday, Berkshire purchased\n80% of NFM, again without an audit. I counted on Blumkin family members to run the business; the third and fourthgeneration do so today. Mrs.", "0 million. That year, on my birthday, Berkshire purchased\n80% of NFM, again without an audit. I counted on Blumkin family members to run the business; the third and fourthgeneration do so today. Mrs. B, it should be noted, worked daily until she was 103 \u2013 a ridiculously prematureretirement age as judged by Charlie and me.\nNFM now owns the three largest home-furnishings stores in the U.S. Each set a sales record in 2020, a feat\nachieved despite the closing of NFM\u2019s stores for more than six weeks because of COVID-19.\nA post-script to this story says it all: When Mrs. B\u2019s large family gathered for holiday meals, she always\nasked that they sing a song before eating. Her selection never varied: Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d\n************\nLet\u2019s move somewhat east to Knoxville, the third largest city in Tennessee. There, Berkshire has ownership\nintworemarkable companies \u2013 Clayton Homes (100% owned) and Pilot Travel Centers (38% owned now, but headed\nfor 80% in 2023).\nEach company was started by a young man who had graduated from the University of Tennessee and stayed\nput in Knoxville. Neither had a meaningful amount of capital nor wealthy parents.\nBut, so what? Today, Clayton and Pilot each have annual pre-tax earnings of more than $1 billion . Together\nthey employ about 47,000 men and women.\nJim Clayton, after several other business ventures, founded Clayton Homes on a shoestring in 1956, and \u201cBig\nJim\u201d Haslam started what became Pilot Travel Centers in 1958 by purchasing a service station for $6,000. Each of themen later brought into the business a son with the same passion, values and brains as his father. Sometimes there is amagic to genes.\n9\n\n\u201cBig Jim\u201d Haslam, now 90, has recently authored an inspirational book in which he relates how Jim Clayton \u2019s\nson, Kevin, encouraged the Haslams to sell a large portion of Pilot to Berkshire. Every retailer knows that satisfiedcustomers are a store\u2019s best salespeople.", "k in which he relates how Jim Clayton \u2019s\nson, Kevin, encouraged the Haslams to sell a large portion of Pilot to Berkshire. Every retailer knows that satisfiedcustomers are a store\u2019s best salespeople. That\u2019s true when businesses are changing hands as well.\n************\nWhen you next fly over Knoxville or Omaha, tip your hat to the Claytons, Haslams and Blumkins as well as\nto the army of successful entrepreneurs who populate every part of our country. These builders needed America\u2019sframework for prosperity \u2013 a unique experiment when it was crafted in 1789 \u2013 to achieve their potential. In turn,America needed citizens like Jim C., Jim H., Mrs. B and Louie to accomplish the miracles our founding fathers sought.\nToday, many people forge similar miracles throughout the world, creating a spread of prosperity that benefits\nallof humanity. In its brief 232 years of existence, however, there has been noincubator for unleashing human\npotential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country\u2019s economic progress has been breathtaking.\nBeyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d Progress on that\nfront has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.\nOur unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America.\nThe Berkshire Partnership\nBerkshire is a Delaware corporation, and our directors must follow the state\u2019s laws. Among them is a\nrequirement that board members must act in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders. Our directors\nembrace that doctrine.\nIn addition, of course, Berkshire directors want the company to delight its customers, to develop and reward\nthe talents of its 360,000 associates, to behave honorably with lenders and to be regarded as a good citizen of the manycities and states in which we operate.", "ght its customers, to develop and reward\nthe talents of its 360,000 associates, to behave honorably with lenders and to be regarded as a good citizen of the manycities and states in which we operate. We value these four important constituencies.\nNone of these groups, however, have a vote in determining such matters as dividends, strategic direction,\nCEO selection, or acquisitions and divestitures. Responsibilities like those fall solely on Berkshire\u2019s directors, who\nmust faithfully represent the long-term interests of the corporation and its owners .\nBeyond legal requirements, Charlie and I feel a special obligation to the many individual shareholders of\nBerkshire. A bit of personal history may help you to understand our unusual attachment and how it shapes ourbehavior.\n************\nBefore my Berkshire years, I managed money for many individuals through a series of partnerships, the first\nthree of those formed in 1956. As time passed, the use of multiple entities became unwieldy and, in 1962, weamalgamated 12 partnerships into a single unit, Buffett Partnership Ltd. (\u201cBPL\u201d).\nBy that year, virtually all of my own money, and that of my wife as well, had become invested alongside the\nfunds of my many limited partners. I received no salary or fees. Instead, as the general partner, I was compensated bymy limited partners only after they secured returns above an annual threshold of 6%. If returns failed to meet thatlevel, the shortfall was to be carried forward against my share of future profits. (Fortunately, that never happened:Partnership returns always exceeded the 6% \u201cbogey.\u201d) As the years went by, a large part of the resources of myparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws became invested in the partnership.\n10\n\nCharlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had anyinstitutional\ninvestors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated.", "d in the partnership.\n10\n\nCharlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had anyinstitutional\ninvestors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated. The people who joined our ventures simplytrusted us to treat their money as we treated our own. These individuals \u2013 either intuitively or by relying on the adviceof friends \u2013 correctly concluded that Charlie and I had an extreme aversion to permanent loss of capital and that wewould not have accepted their money unless we expected to do reasonably well with it.\nI stumbled into business management after BPL acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. Later still, in 1969,\nwe decided to dissolve BPL. After yearend, the partnership distributed, pro-rata, all of its cash along with three stocks,the largest by value being BPL\u2019s 70.5% interest in Berkshire.\nCharlie, meanwhile, wound up his operation in 1977. Among the assets he distributed to partners was a major\ninterest in Blue Chip Stamps, a company his partnership, Berkshire and I jointly controlled. Blue Chip was also amongthe three stocks my partnership had distributed upon its dissolution.\nIn 1983, Berkshire and Blue Chip merged, thereby expanding Berkshire\u2019s base of registered shareholders\nfrom 1,900 to 2,900. Charlie and I wanted everyone \u2013 old, new and prospective shareholders \u2013 to be on the same page.\nTherefore, the 1983 annual report \u2013 up front \u2013 laid out Berkshire\u2019s \u201cmajor business principles.\u201d The first\nprinciple began: \u201cAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.\u201d That defined our relationship in 1983;it defines it today.", "laid out Berkshire\u2019s \u201cmajor business principles.\u201d The first\nprinciple began: \u201cAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.\u201d That defined our relationship in 1983;it defines it today. Charlie and I \u2013 and our directors as well \u2013 believe this dictum will serve Berkshire well for manydecades to come.\n************\nOwnership of Berkshire now resides in five large \u201cbuckets,\u201d one occupied by me as a \u201cfounder\u201d of sorts.\nThat bucket is certain to empty as the shares I own are annually distributed to various philanthropies.\nTwo of the remaining four buckets are filled by institutional investors, each handling other people\u2019s money .\nThat, however, is where the similarity between those buckets ends: Their investing procedures could not be moredifferent.\nIn one institutional bucket are index funds, a large and mushrooming segment of the investment world. These\nfunds simply mimic the index that they track. The favorite of index investors is the S&P 500, of which Berkshire is acomponent. Index funds, it should be emphasized, own Berkshire shares simply because they are required to do so.\nThey are on automatic pilot, buying and selling onlyfor \u201cweighting\u201d purposes.\nIn the other institutional bucket are professionals who manage their clients\u2019 money, whether those funds\nbelong to wealthy individuals, universities, pensioners or whomever. These professional managers have a mandate tomove funds from one investment to another based on their judgment as to valuation and prospects. That is anhonorable, though difficult, occupation.\nWe are happy to work for this \u201cactive\u201d group, while they meanwhile search for a better place to deploy the\nfunds of their clientele. Some managers, to be sure, have a long-term focus and trade very infrequently. Others usecomputers employing algorithms that may direct the purchase or sale of shares in a nano-second.", "eir clientele. Some managers, to be sure, have a long-term focus and trade very infrequently. Others usecomputers employing algorithms that may direct the purchase or sale of shares in a nano-second. Some professionalinvestors will come and go based upon their macro-economic judgments.\nOur fourth bucket consists of individual shareholders who operate in a manner similar to the active\ninstitutional managers I\u2019ve just described. These owners, understandably, think of their Berkshire shares as a possiblesource of funds when they see another investment that excites them. We have no quarrel with that attitude, which issimilar to the way we look at some of the equities we own at Berkshire.\n11\n\nAll of that said, Charlie and I would be less than human if we did not feel a special kinship with our fifth\nbucket: the million-plus individual investors who simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future may\nbring. They have joined us with no intent to leave, adopting a mindset similar to that held by our original partners.Indeed, many investors from our partnership years, and/or their descendants, remain substantial owners of Berkshire.\nA prototype of those veterans is Stan Truhlsen, a cheerful and generous Omaha ophthalmologist as well as\npersonal friend, who turned 100 on November 13, 2020. In 1959, Stan, along with 10 other young Omaha doctors,formed a partnership with me. The docs creatively labeled their venture Emdee, Ltd. Annually, they joined my wifeand me for a celebratory dinner at our home.\nWhen our partnership distributed its Berkshire shares in 1969, allof the doctors kept the stock they received.\nThey may not have known the ins and outs of investing or accounting, but they didknow that at Berkshire they would\nbe treated as partners.\nTwo of Stan\u2019s comrades from Emdee are now in their high-90s and continue to hold Berkshire shares.", "ts of investing or accounting, but they didknow that at Berkshire they would\nbe treated as partners.\nTwo of Stan\u2019s comrades from Emdee are now in their high-90s and continue to hold Berkshire shares. This\ngroup\u2019s startling durability \u2013 along with the fact that Charlie and I are 97 and 90, respectively \u2013 serves up an interestingquestion: Could it be that Berkshire ownership fosters longevity?\n************\nBerkshire\u2019s unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of our\nreluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We already have the investors we want and don\u2019t\nthink that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements.\nThere are only so many seats \u2013 that is, shares outstanding \u2013 available for Berkshire ownership. And we very\nmuch like the people already occupying them.\nOf course, some turnover in \u201cpartners\u201d will occur. Charlie and I hope, however, that it will be minimal. Who,\nafter all, seeks rapid turnover in friends, neighbors or marriage?\nIn 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company to\nmanaging a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either\nhamburgers served with a Coke ora French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines. But you must not, Fisher warned,\ncapriciously switch from one to the other: Your message to potential customers must be consistent with what they willfind upon entering your premises.\nAt Berkshire, we have been serving hamburgers and Coke for 56 years. We cherish the clientele this fare has\nattracted.\nThe tens of millions of other investors and speculators in the United States and elsewhere have a wide variety\nof equity choices to fit their tastes.

Indeed, a patient and level-headed monkey, who constructs a portfolio by throwing 50 darts ata board listing all of the S&P 500, will \u2013 over time \u2013 enjoy dividends and capital gains, just as long as it never gets\ntempted to make changes in its original \u201cselections.\u201d\n12\n\nProductive assets such as farms, real estate and, yes, business ownership produce wealth \u2013 lots of it.

And, unlike my monkey, Wall Streeters do not work for peanuts.\nWhen seats open up at Berkshire \u2013 and we hope they are few \u2013 we want them to be occupied by newcomers\nwho understand and desire what we offer. After decades of management, Charlie and I remain unable to promiseresults. We cananddo, however, pledge to treat you as partners.\nAnd so, too, will our successors.\nA Berkshire Number that May Surprise You\nRecently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based\nproperty, plant and equipment \u2013 the sort of assets that make up the \u201cbusiness infrastructure\u201d of our country \u2013 with aGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by anyother U.S. company. Berkshire\u2019s depreciated cost of these\ndomestic \u201cfixed assets\u201d is $154 billion.", "the \u201cbusiness infrastructure\u201d of our country \u2013 with aGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by anyother U.S. company. Berkshire\u2019s depreciated cost of these\ndomestic \u201cfixed assets\u201d is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127\nbillion.\nOur leadership in fixed-asset ownership, I should add, does not, in itself, signal an investment triumph. The\nbestresults occur at companies that require minimal assets to conduct high-margin businesses \u2013 andoffer goods or\nservices that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital. We, in fact, own a few ofthese exceptional businesses, but they are relatively small and, at best, grow slowly.\nAsset-heavy companies, however, can be good investments. Indeed, we are delighted with our two\ngiants \u2013 BNSF and BHE: In 2011, Berkshire\u2019s first full year of BNSF ownership, the two companies had combinedearnings of $4.2 billion. In 2020, a tough year for many businesses, the pair earned $8.3 billion.\nBNSF and BHE will require major capital expenditures for decades to come. The good news is that both are\nlikely to deliver appropriate returns on the incremental investment.\nLet\u2019s look first at BNSF. Your railroad carries about 15% of all non-local ton-miles (a ton of freight moved\none mile) of goods that move in the United States, whether by rail, truck, pipeline, barge or aircraft. By a significantmargin, BNSF\u2019s loads top those of any other carrier.\nThe history of American railroads is fascinating. After 150 years or so of frenzied construction, skullduggery,\noverbuilding, bankruptcies, reorganizations and mergers, the railroad industry finally emerged a few decades ago asmature and rationalized.\nBNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedents\nwhose railroads have been purchased or merged.", "d a few decades ago asmature and rationalized.\nBNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedents\nwhose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company\u2019s extensive lineage is laid out athttp://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf.\nBerkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixed\nassets, an outlay $20 billion in excess of its depreciation charges. Railroading is an outdoor sport, featuring mile-longtrains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrainfrom deserts to mountains. Massive flooding periodically occurs. BNSF owns 23,000 miles of track, spread throughout28 states, and must spend whatever it takes to maximize safety and service throughout its vast system.\n13\n\nNevertheless, BNSF has paid substantial dividends to Berkshire \u2013 $41.8 billion in total. The railroad pays us,\nhowever, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about$2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt byBerkshire.\nOne further word about BNSF: Last year, Carl Ice, its CEO, and his number two, Katie Farmer, did an\nextraordinary job in controlling expenses while navigating a significant downturn in business. Despite a 7% declinein the volume of goods carried, the two actually increased BNSF\u2019s profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Carl, aslong planned, retired at yearend and Katie took over as CEO. Your railroad is in good hands.\nBHE, unlike BNSF, pays nodividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utility\nindustry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country\u2019selectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering.", ". That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country\u2019selectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all ofBHE\u2019s earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will beappropriately rewarded.\nLet me tell you about one of BHE\u2019s endeavors \u2013 its $18 billion commitment to rework and expand a\nsubstantial portion of the outdated grid that now transmits electricity throughout the West. BHE began this project in2006 and expects it to be completed by 2030 \u2013 yes, 2030.\nThe advent of renewable energy made our project a societal necessity. Historically, the coal-based generation\nof electricity that long prevailed was located close to huge centers of population. The best sites for the new world ofwind and solar generation, however, are often in remote areas. When BHE assessed the situation in 2006, it was nosecret that a huge investment in western transmission lines had to be made. Very few companies or governmentalentities, however, were in a financial position to raise their hand after they tallied the project\u2019s cost.\nBHE\u2019s decision to proceed, it should be noted, was based upon its trust in America\u2019s political, economic and\njudicial systems. Billions of dollars needed to be invested before meaningful revenue would flow. Transmission lineshad to cross the borders of states and other jurisdictions, each with its own rules and constituencies. BHE would alsoneed to deal with hundreds of landowners and execute complicated contracts with both the suppliers that generatedrenewable power and the far-away utilities that would distribute the electricity to their customers. Competing interestsand defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought onboard.\nBoth surprises and delays were certain.", "ir customers. Competing interestsand defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought onboard.\nBoth surprises and delays were certain. Equally certain, however, was the fact that BHE had the managerial\ntalent, the institutional commitment and the financial wherewithal to fulfill its promises. Though it will be many yearsbefore our western transmission project is completed, we are today searching for other projects of similar size to takeon.\nWhatever the obstacles, BHE will be a leader in delivering ever-cleaner energy.\nThe Annual Meeting\nLast year, on February 22\nnd, I wrote you about our plans for a gala annual meeting.

We are\nhonored by your trust.\nOur position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the\nabsentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and\nthrough the annual meeting as well.\nOur policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large\ninstitutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.\nA wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with\nthe S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 \u2013 K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.\nAlas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the\nintrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.\nWhat You Own\nBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part.

The second group\nlargely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.\nWhatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable\neconomic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nI make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that\nhave truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that \u2013 on occasion \u2013 it becomes easy to buy pieces of\nwonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated\ntransactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the\nmarketable arena.\n3\n\nSurprise, Surprise\nHere are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:\n\u2022 Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,\nBerkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based \u201cinfrastructure\u201d assets \u2013 classified on our balance sheet as\nproperty, plant and equipment \u2013 than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That\nsupremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.\nAt yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire\u2019s balance sheet at $158 billion.\nThat number increased last year and will continue to increase.", "has, however, become a fact.\nAt yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire\u2019s balance sheet at $158 billion.\nThat number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.\n\u2022 Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid\n$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.\nAdditionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. \u201cI gave at the office\u201d is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.\nBerkshire\u2019s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between\ngovernment and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.\nThe Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that \u201cThe combination of the resources and\nmanagements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.\u201d Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company\u2019s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).\nI\u2019m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union\nwas consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.\nIn the nine years following the merger, Berkshire\u2019s owners watched the company\u2019s net worth crater from\n$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well.", "1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire\u2019s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.\nDuring the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire\u2019s troubles. All told, the\ncompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period \u2013 a pathetic $100 per day .\nEarly in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and\nsteered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the\nyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.\nBerkshire\u2019s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their \u201csilent\npartner,\u201d the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income\ntax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.\n4\n\nIn fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge \u2013 indeed trumpet \u2013 the fact\nthat Berkshire\u2019s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our\ncountry would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,\nhowever, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.\n\u2022 From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in\ninsurance \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us.", "ag, saythanks.\n\u2022 From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in\ninsurance \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small\nsum derived from life insurance, Berkshire\u2019s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the\ninsurance business to $147 billion .\nSo far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance\nlosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year\nprofit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.\nOf equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,\nbut their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.\nIf you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To\nmy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (\u201cgenerally-accepted accounting principles\u201d) presentation of earnings\nand net worth.\nMuch of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire\u2019s good luck in my 1986 hiring of\nAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, \u201cNone.\u201d\nI said, \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect,\u201d and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as\ncould have been made. Better yet, he continues to be \u2013 35 years later.\nOne final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely \u2013 but farfrom assured \u2013 that Berkshire\u2019s float\ncan be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss.", "\u2013 35 years later.\nOne final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely \u2013 but farfrom assured \u2013 that Berkshire\u2019s float\ncan be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain , however, that there will\nbe some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.\nBerkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer \u2013 and that priority will remain long\nafter Charlie and I are gone.\nOur Four Giants\nThrough Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a\ncollection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.\n\u2022 Nevertheless, operations of our \u201cBig Four\u201d companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire\u2019s value.\nLeading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.\n5\n\nThe insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume\nwill generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.\nThere are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire\u2019s\noperation, however, would be almost impossible.\n\u2022 Apple \u2013 our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value \u2013 is a different sort of holding. Here,\nour ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple\u2019s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million .

Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple\u2019s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds\nto gain our accretion. Apple\u2019s repurchases did the job.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire\nreports \u2013 and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our \u201cshare\u201d of Apple\u2019s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act\nwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim\u2019s managerial touch as well.\n\u2022 BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an\nindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America\u2019s carbon emissions would soar.\nYour railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the\nold-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,\namortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive \u201cadjustments\u201d toearnings \u2013 to use a polite description \u2013 have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen.

That\u2019s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million\nearned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.\nBHE\u2019s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had\nnowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in\nthe huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol\u2019s and Greg Abel\u2019s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.\nGreg\u2019s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not\nin any way one of those currently-fashionable \u201cgreen-washing\u201d stories.

We want your company to be financially impregnable and never\ndependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants and you to do so as well.\nBut $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lost\nour overwhelming preference for business ownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago,\non March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequired allof my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:\nNever bet against America.)\nAfter my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favored status throughout\nthat period was 100% \u2013 and still is. Berkshire\u2019s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.\nCharlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods are\nnever pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.\nShare Repurchases\nThere are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and center\nin our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire\u2019s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire\u2019s resources.\nOur second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are\npublicly traded.", "e of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire\u2019s resources.\nOur second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are\npublicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, wefind little that excites us.\nThat\u2019s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of allproductive\ninvestments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influencevaluations as well, but interest rates will always be important.\nOur final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase your\nshare of the many controlled and non-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right,\nthis path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value tocontinuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of therepurchased shares and to society as well.)\n8\n\nPeriodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire\u2019s owners.\nDuring the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9% of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a total\ncost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10% more of allBerkshire\nbusinesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola andMoody\u2019s).\nI want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value.\nWe don\u2019t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value -destroying if we were to overpay\nwhen we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion.", "ther companies, and it would be value -destroying if we were to overpay\nwhen we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.\nIt should be noted that Berkshire\u2019s buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base.\nIf our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.\nFinally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we\u2019ve discussed, insurance \u201cfloat\u201d\nof the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of \u201cfloat\u201d per\nshare . That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% \u2013 going from $79,387 per \u201cA\u201d share to $99,497, a\nmeaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.\nA Wonderful Man and a Wonderful Business\nLast year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary of\nBerkshire. Throughout his life \u2013 in both his business and his personal pursuits \u2013 Paul quietly displayed all the qualities\nthat Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.\nIn 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing a\nhuge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.\nWith his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics\n(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000.", "cided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics\n(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion.\nBut back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But he\nhad one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend\u2019s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man\u2019s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending on him if he should unexpectedly die?\nFor a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, that\ncourse made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative \u201csynergies\u201d \u2013 savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.\nB u t...S u c hap u r c h aser would most certainly also retain itsCFO, itslegal counsel, itsHR unit. Their TTI\ncounterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer\u2019shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.\n9\n\nWhatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He next\nconsidered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled \u2013 aptly so \u2013 a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an \u201cexit strategy.\u201d And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.\nWhen Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers.", "oodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.\nWhen Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summed\nup his dilemma by saying \u2013 in far more tactful phrasing than this \u2013 \u201cAfter a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.\u201d So, I made an offer and Paul said \u201cYes.\u201d One meeting; onelunch; one deal.\nTo say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the company\nemployed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.\nAnnually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tell\nme, \u201cWe can talk about that next year, Warren; I\u2019m too busy now.\u201d\nWhen Greg Abel and I attended Paul\u2019s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-time\nassociates (including TTI\u2019s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.\nAt the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silently\nsupported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary \u2013 geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.\nIn all ways, Paul was a class act.\n************\nGood luck \u2013 occasionally extraordinary luck \u2013 has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed\na mutual friend \u2013 John Roach \u2013 TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.\nEvery fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives.", "at ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.\nEvery fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choose\nthe site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary\u2019sCEO and learn more about the acquiree\u2019s activities.\nIn the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF,\nwhich also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite thatlarge stake, I had never visited the railroad\u2019s headquarters.\nDeb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board\u2019s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged to\narrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When Imade the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF\u2019s third-quarter earnings report, whichwas released late on the 22\nnd.\nThe market reacted badly to the railroad\u2019s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter,\nand BNSF\u2019s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn\u2019t feelingfriendly to railroads \u2013 or much else.\n10\n\nOn the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad a\nbetter long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshirewould pay.\nMatt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announced\na firm deal. And here I\u2019ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a century\nfrom now.\nThe BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn\u2019t sized up Berkshire as the right\nhome for TTI.\nThanks\nI taught my first investing class 70 years ago.", "country a century\nfrom now.\nThe BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn\u2019t sized up Berkshire as the right\nhome for TTI.\nThanks\nI taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year with\nstudents of all ages, finally \u201cretiring\u201d from that pursuit in 2018.\nAlong the way, my toughest audience was my grandson\u2019s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirming\nin their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that \u201csecrets\u201d are catnip to kids.\nTeaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon\nthe orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.\nTalking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)\nwith the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may\ninterfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be \u201cworking.\u201d\nCharlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-\ntimers at my grandfather\u2019s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.\nFinally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now \u201cworked\u201d for\nmany decades with people whom we like and trust.

Anyone\ncan buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type ofshareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to doso.\n11\n\nTo a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and families\nthat have elected to join us with an intent approaching \u201ctil death do us part.\u201d Often, they have trusted us with a large\u2013 some might say excessive \u2013 portion of their savings.\nBerkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the best selection they could\nhave made.

We are grateful for their enduring trust, a relationship that often spans\nmuch of their adult lifetime. It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I writethis letter.\nA common belief is that people choose to save when young, expecting thereby to maintain\ntheir living standards after retirement. Any assets that remain at death, this theory says, will usuallybe left to their families or, possibly, to friends and philanthropy.\nOur experience has differed. We believe Berkshire\u2019s individual holders largely to be of the\nonce-a-saver, always-a-saver variety. Though these people live well, they eventually dispensemost of their funds to philanthropic organizations. These, in turn, redistribute the funds byexpenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the originalbenefactor. Sometimes, the results have been spectacular.\nThe disposition of money unmasks humans. Charlie and I watch with pleasure the vast flow\nof Berkshire-generated funds to public needs and, alongside, the infrequency with which ourshareholders opt for look-at-me assets and dynasty-building.\nWho wouldn\u2019t enjoy working for shareholders like ours?\nWhat We Do\nCharlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership.\nFirst, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each.", "hareholders like ours?\nWhat We Do\nCharlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership.\nFirst, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directscapital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operatingdecisions. When large enterprises are being managed, both trust and rules are essential. Berkshireemphasizes the former to an unusual \u2013 some would say extreme \u2013 degree. Disappointments areinevitable. We are understanding about business mistakes; our tolerance for personal misconduct\nis zero.\nIn our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we\npassively own pieces of businesses. Holding these investments, we have no say in management.\n3\n\nOur goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with\nboth long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please noteparticularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-termbusiness performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That\npoint is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\nOver the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of\nbusinesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, manythat enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way,other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public.Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrentlydelivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon \u201ccreativedestruction.\u201d\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that \u2013 episodically \u2013 it becomes easy to\nbuy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices.", "humpeter called this phenomenon \u201ccreativedestruction.\u201d\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that \u2013 episodically \u2013 it becomes easy to\nbuy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices.

They sometimes command ridiculously higher\nprices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations. Unless under duress, theowner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation.\n************\nAt this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management,\nmost of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, badmoves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes fromnear-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.)\nOur satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions \u2013 that\nwould be about one every five years \u2013 anda sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term\ninvestors such as Berkshire. Let\u2019s take a peek behind the curtain.\nThe Secret Sauce\nIn August 1994 \u2013 yes, 1994 \u2013 Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400\nmillion shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion \u2013 then a very meaningfuls u ma tB e r k s h i r e .\nThe cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend\nhad increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie\nand I were required to do was cash Coke\u2019s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checksa r eh i g h l yl i k e l yt og r o w .\n4\n\nAmerican Express is much the same story.", "thdays. All Charlie\nand I were required to do was cash Coke\u2019s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checksa r eh i g h l yl i k e l yt og r o w .\n4\n\nAmerican Express is much the same story. Berkshire\u2019s purchases of Amex were essentially\ncompleted in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from thisinvestment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely\nto increase.\nThese dividend gains, though pleasing, are farfrom spectacular. But they bring with them\nimportant gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion whileAmex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire\u2019s networth, akin to its weighting long ago.\nAssume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one\nthat flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be ahigh-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant0.3% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so ofannual income.\nThe lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom.\nOver time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and liveinto your 90s as well.\nThe Past Year in Brief\nBerkshire had a good year in 2022. The company\u2019s operating earnings \u2013 our term for\nincome calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), exclusive of\ncapital gains or losses from equity holdings \u2013 set a record at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus onthis operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment ,\nfluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date.", "ord at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus onthis operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment ,\nfluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date.

Capital\ngains, to be sure, have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades, and we expect themto be meaningfully positive in future decades. But their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly andmindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.\n5\n\nA second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany\nCorporation, a property-casualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon. I\u2019ve worked with Joe in thepast, and he understands both Berkshire and insurance. Alleghany delivers special value tous because Berkshire\u2019s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to followvaluable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors.\nAided by Alleghany, our insurance float increased during 2022 from $147 billion to $164\nbillion. With disciplined underwriting, these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over\ntime. Since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in 1967, Berkshire\u2019s float has increased8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations. Though notrecognized in our\nfinancial statements, this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire. New shareholderscan get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float onpage A-2.\n************\nAvery minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share\nrepurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investeesof ours.", "*******\nAvery minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share\nrepurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investeesof ours. At Berkshire, we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses byrepurchasing 1.2% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. At Apple and Amex, repurchasesincreased Berkshire\u2019s ownership a bit without any cost to us.\nThe math isn\u2019t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many\nbusinesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just\nas surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such\ntimes, gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly, but expensive, investment\nbanker who recommended the foolish purchases.\nGains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit allowners \u2013 in\nevery respect. Imagine, if you will, three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership,\none of whom manages the business. Imagine, further, that one of the passive owners wishes to sellhis interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders. Whencompleted, has this transaction harmed anyone? Is the manager somehow favored over thecontinuing passive owners? Has the public been hurt?\nWhen you are told that allrepurchases are harmful to shareholders orto the country, or\nparticularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or asilver-tongued demagogue (characters that are notmutually exclusive).\n6\n\nAlmost endless details of Berkshire\u2019s 2022 operations are laid out on pages K-33 \u2013 K-66.\nCharlie and I, along with many Berkshire shareholders, enjoy poring over the many facts andfigures laid out in that section.

There are many\nBerkshire centimillionaires and, yes, billionaires who have never studied our financial figures.They simply know that Charlie and I \u2013 along with our families and close friends \u2013 continue to havevery significant investments in Berkshire, and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own.\nAnd thatis a promise we can make.\n************\nFinally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily\nbe manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticatedby CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well.Beating \u201cexpectations\u201d is heralded as a managerial triumph.\nThat activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire\nto deceive is required. \u201cBold imaginative accounting,\u201d as a CEO once described his deception tome, has become one of the shames of capitalism.\n58 Years \u2013 and a Few Figures\nIn 1965, Berkshire was a one-trick pony, the owner of a venerable \u2013 but doomed \u2013 New\nEngland textile operation. With that business on a death march, Berkshire needed an immediatefresh start. Looking back, I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems.\nAnd then came a stroke of good luck: National Indemnity became available in 1967, and\nwe shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations.\nThus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous\nsavings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, ouravoidance of major mistakes and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 the American Tailwind. America would\nhave done fine without Berkshire.", "s (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, ouravoidance of major mistakes and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 the American Tailwind. America would\nhave done fine without Berkshire. The reverse is nottrue.\nBerkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified\nbusinesses. Let\u2019s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily onNASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&P500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies.\nIn aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don\u2019t yet have the final results for 2022.\nUsing, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billionor more. Indeed, 23 lost money.\n7\n\nAt yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American\nExpress, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody\u2019s, Occidental Petroleum andParamount Global.\nIn addition to those eight investees, Berkshire owns 100% of BNSF and 92% of BH\nEnergy, each with earnings that exceed the $3 billion mark noted above ($5.9 billion at BNSF and$4.3 billion at BHE). Were these companies publicly-owned, they would replace two presentmembers of the 500. All told, our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshiremore broadly aligned with the country\u2019s economic future than is the case at any other U.S.company. (This calculation leaves aside \u201cfiduciary\u201d operations such as pension funds andinvestment companies.) In addition, Berkshire\u2019s insurance operation, though conducted throughmany individually-managed subsidiaries, has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE.\nAs for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills\nalong with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any\nuncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedentedinsurance losses.", "ong with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any\nuncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedentedinsurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer \u2013 a task it is irresponsible todelegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshireshares, bought with their own money. Andyes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper\nby retaining earnings.\nAt Berkshire, there will be no finish line.\nSome Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes\nDuring the decade ending in 2021, the United States Treasury received about $32.3 trillion\nin taxes while it spent $43.9 trillion.\nThough economists, politicians and many of the public have opinions about the\nconsequences of that huge imbalance, Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe thatnear-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless. Our job is to manage Berkshire\u2019soperations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that willpreserve the company\u2019s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwiderecessions occur. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but thisattribute is farfrom perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.\nThe $32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes\n(48%), social security and related receipts (34\n1\u20442%), corporate income tax payments (81\u20442%) and a\nwide variety of lesser levies. Berkshire\u2019s contribution via the corporate income tax was $32 billionduring the decade, almost exactly a tenth of 1% of allmoney that the Treasury collected.\n8\n\nAnd that means \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S.\nmatching Berkshire\u2019s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country\u2019s 131 millionhouseholds would have needed to pay anytaxes to the federal government.", "been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S.\nmatching Berkshire\u2019s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country\u2019s 131 millionhouseholds would have needed to pay anytaxes to the federal government.

We\nowe the country no less: America\u2019s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever successBerkshire has achieved \u2013 a contribution Berkshire will always need.

But, at Berkshire, we can be stubborn.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMake no mistake about the significance of capital gains: I expect them to be a very\nimportant component of Berkshire\u2019s value accretion during the decades ahead. Why else would we commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie\u2019s) to marketable equities just as I have been doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime?\nI can\u2019t remember a period since March 11, 1942 \u2013 the date of my first stock purchase \u2013 that\nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based  equities. And so far, so good.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I \u201cpulled the trigger.\u201d I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that index hovers around 38,000. America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have needed to do is sit quietly, listening to no one.\nIt is more than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire\u2019s investment value based\non \u201cearnings\u201d that incorporate the capricious day-by-day  and, yes, even year-by-year movements\nof the stock market.", "re than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire\u2019s investment value based\non \u201cearnings\u201d that incorporate the capricious day-by-day  and, yes, even year-by-year movements\nof the stock market. As Ben Graham taught me, \u201cIn the short run the market acts as a voting machine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.\u201d\nWhat We Do\nOur goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that\nenjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. Within capitalism, some businesses will flourish for a very long time while others will prove to be sinkholes. It\u2019s harder than you would think to predict which will be the winners and losers. And those who tell you they know the answer are usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen.\nAt Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional  capital at\nhigh returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies \u2013 and simply sitting tight \u2013 can deliver wealth almost beyond measure. Even heirs to such a holding can \u2013 ugh! \u2013 sometimes live a lifetime of leisure.\nWe also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though\nthat is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share of disappointments.\n5\n\nIn 1863, Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all\nnational banks. His instructions included this warning: \u201cNever deal with a rascal under the expectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.\u201d Many bankers who thought they could \u201cmanage\u201d the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch\u2019s advice \u2013 and I have as well. People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true now as it was in 1863.\nThis combination of the two necessities I\u2019ve described for acquiring businesses has for\nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate.", "t was in 1863.\nThis combination of the two necessities I\u2019ve described for acquiring businesses has for\nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate. If I missed one \u2013 and I missed plenty \u2013 another always came along.\nThose days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases\nwas also a factor.\nBerkshire now has \u2013 by far  \u2013 the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American\nbusiness. Record operating income and a strong stock market led to a yearend figure of $561 billion. The total GAAP net worth for the other 499 S&P companies \u2013 a who\u2019s who of American\nbusiness \u2013 was $8.9 trillion in 2022. (The 2023 number for the S&P has not yet been tallied but is unlikely to materially exceed $9.5 trillion.)\nBy this measure, Berkshire now occupies nearly 6% of the universe in which it operates.\nDoubling our huge base is simply not possible within, say, a five-year period, particularly because we are highly averse to issuing shares (an act that immediately juices net worth).\nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the\nneedle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can\u2019t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful  options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All\nin all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\nNevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive\nside, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.

And we now have a small cadre of long-time managers who never muse about going elsewhere and who regard 65 as just another birthday.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire benefits from an unusual constancy and clarity of purpose. While we emphasize\ntreating our employees, communities and suppliers well \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t  wish to do so? \u2013 our\nallegiance will always  be to our country and our shareholders. We never forget that, though your\nmoney is comingled  with ours, it does not belong  to us.\n6\n\nWith that focus, and with our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should  do a bit better\nthan the average American corporation and, more important, should  also operate with materially\nless risk of permanent loss of capital. Anything beyond \u201cslightly better,\u201d though, is wishful thinking. This modest aspiration wasn\u2019t the case when Bertie went all-in on Berkshire \u2013 but it is now.\nOur Not-So-Secret Weapon\nOccasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and\nfundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can \u2013 and will \u2013 unpredictably seize up or even vanish  as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days\nin 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate  instant\nworldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won\u2019t happen often \u2013 but they will happen.\nBerkshire\u2019s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and\ncertainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity.", "happen often \u2013 but they will happen.\nBerkshire\u2019s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and\ncertainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock\nmarket is massively larger than it was in our early years, today\u2019s active  participants are neither\nmore emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\nOne fact of financial life should never be forgotten. Wall Street \u2013 to use the term in its\nfigurative sense \u2013 would like its customers to make money, but what truly causes its denizens\u2019\njuices to flow is feverish activity. At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be\nvigorously marketed \u2013 not by everyone but always by someone.\nOccasionally, the scene turns ugly. The politicians then become enraged; the most flagrant\nperpetrators of misdeeds slip away, rich and unpunished; and your friend next door becomes bewildered, poorer and sometimes vengeful. Money, he learns, has trumped morality.\nOne investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never  risk permanent loss\nof capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been \u2013 and will be \u2013 rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a\nlifetime and avoid serious mistakes.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI believe Berkshire can handle financial  disasters of a magnitude beyond any heretofore\nexperienced. This ability is one we will not relinquish. When economic upsets occur, as they will, Berkshire\u2019s goal will be to function as an asset  to the country \u2013 just as it was in a very minor way\nin 2008-9 \u2013 and to help extinguish  the financial fire rather than to be among the many companies\nthat, inadvertently or otherwise, ignited the conflagration.\n7\n\nOur goal is realistic.", "very minor way\nin 2008-9 \u2013 and to help extinguish  the financial fire rather than to be among the many companies\nthat, inadvertently or otherwise, ignited the conflagration.\n7\n\nOur goal is realistic. Berkshire\u2019s strength comes from its Niagara of diverse earnings\ndelivered after  interest costs, taxes and substantial charges for depreciation and amortization\n(\u201cEBITDA\u201d is a banned measurement at Berkshire). We also operate with minimal requirements for cash, even if the country encounters a prolonged period of global economic weakness, fear and near-paralysis.\nBerkshire does not currently pay dividends, and its share repurchases are 100%\ndiscretionary. Annual debt maturities are never material.\nYour company also holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill  position far in excess of what\nconventional wisdom deems necessary. During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated  cash from\noperations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared  for one.\nExtreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in\nownership of Berkshire. In most years \u2013 indeed in most decades \u2013 our caution will likely prove to be unneeded behavior \u2013 akin to an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought  to be\nfireproof.

These are not huge commitments like our Apple position. Each only accounts for 4-5% of Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worth.", "kshire\u2019s long-duration partial-ownership\npositions \u2013 Coca-Cola and American Express. These are not huge commitments like our Apple position. Each only accounts for 4-5% of Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worth. But they are meaningful assets and also illustrate our thought processes.\nAmerican Express began operations in 1850, and Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta\ndrug store in 1886. (Berkshire is not big on newcomers.) Both companies tried expanding into\nunrelated areas over the years and both found little success in these attempts. In the past \u2013 but definitely  not now \u2013 both were even mismanaged.\nBut each was hugely successful in its base business, reshaped here and there as conditions\ncalled for. And, crucially, their products \u201ctraveled.\u201d Both Coke and AMEX became recognizable names worldwide as did their core products, and the consumption of liquids and the need for\nunquestioned financial trust are timeless essentials of our world.\n8\n\nDuring 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke \u2013 extending our own\nRip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings  in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase.\nBoth AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 \u2013 about 16%\nin the case of AMEX \u2013 and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the\nyear. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell\nyou: \u201cNo way.\u201d\nThough Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect\nownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every  asset that Berkshire\nowns.

To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases\nshould be price-dependent.

Patience  pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that\nare inevitable.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThis year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain\nindefinitely. Like Coke and AMEX, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources. They are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023.\nAt yearend, Berkshire owned 27.8% of Occidental Petroleum\u2019s common shares and also\nowned warrants that, for more than five years, give us the option  to materially increase our\nownership at a fixed price. Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option, Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental. We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very much in our country\u2019s interest.\nNot so long ago, the U.S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had\nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U.S. production was eight million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (\u201cBOEPD\u201d), a level far short of the country\u2019s needs. From the favorable energy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to become heavily dependent on foreign \u2013 potentially unstable \u2013 suppliers.", "needs. From the favorable energy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to become heavily dependent on foreign \u2013 potentially unstable \u2013 suppliers. Further declines in oil production were predicted along with future increases in usage.\n9\n\nFor a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five\nmillion BOEPD by 2007. Meanwhile, the U.S. government created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (\u201cSPR\u201d) in 1975 to alleviate \u2013 though not come close to eliminating \u2013 this erosion of American self-sufficiency.\nAnd then \u2013 Hallelujah! \u2013 shale economics became feasible in 2011, and our energy\ndependency ended. Now, U.S. production is more than 13 million BOEPD, and OPEC no longer has the upper hand. Occidental itself has annual U.S. oil production that each year comes close to matching the entire inventory of the SPR. Our country would be very \u2013 very \u2013 nervous today if\ndomestic production had remained at five million BOEPD, and it found itself hugely dependent on non-U.S. sources. At that level, the SPR would have been emptied within months if foreign oil became unavailable.\nUnder Vicki Hollub\u2019s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country\nand its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But\nVicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that\u2019s an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAdditionally, Berkshire continues to hold its passive and long-term interest in five very\nlarge Japanese companies, each of which operates in a highly-diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel and I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five.", "ay Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel and I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies\ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U.S.) Berkshire has also pledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%. Our cost for the five totals \u00a51.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was \u00a52.9 trillion. However, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was 61% or $8 billion.\nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don\u2019t\nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese position with the proceeds from \u00a51.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in Japan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other American company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion, a sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the 2020-23 period.\nIn certain important ways, all five companies \u2013 Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and\nSumitomo \u2013 follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each  of the five has reduced the\nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices .\n10\n\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about\ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States.

The large sums the five retain are used both to\nbuild their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue  shares.\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to\nopportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs have the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be instantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\nOur Japanese purchases began on July 4, 2019. Given Berkshire\u2019s present size, building\npositions through open-market purchases takes a lot of patience and an extended period of \u201cfriendly\u201d prices. The process is like turning a battleship. That is an important disadvantage which we did not face in our early days at Berkshire.\nThe Scorecard in 2023\nEvery quarter we issue a press release that reports our summarized operating earnings (or\nloss) in a manner similar to what is shown below.

I followed with a short summary of the outlook for the full year: (1) most of our non-insurance  businesses faced lower earnings in 2023; (2) that\ndecline would be cushioned by decent results at our two largest non-insurance businesses, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) which, combined, had accounted for more than 30% of operating earnings in 2022; (3) our investment income was certain  to materially grow because the\nhuge U.S. Treasury bill position held by Berkshire had finally begun to pay us far more than the pittance we had been receiving and (4) insurance would likely do well, both because its underwriting earnings are not correlated to earnings elsewhere in the economy and, beyond that, property-casualty insurance prices had strengthened.\n11\n\nInsurance came through as expected. I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\nand BHE. Let\u2019s take a look at each.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRail is essential to America\u2019s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\nway \u2013 measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity \u2013 of moving heavy materials to distant destinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must  travel to\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can\u2019t run without rail, and the industry\u2019s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American businesses, railroads eat capital.\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted other fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet.", "ems that blanket North America. Our railroad\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted other fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least $500 billion to replicate those assets and decades  to complete the job.\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain  its present\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested, but it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess  of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $1\n1\u20442 billion annually. Ouch! That sort of\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall  considerably short of\nBNSF\u2019s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad\u2019s debt. And that we do not intend to do.\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That\u2019s no surprise to me or Berkshire\u2019s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a small fraction of its replacement value.\nNorth America\u2019s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\nexported goods, etc. one-way  for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\nback-hauls.

None of this is a surprise.", "e problem for\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization of track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I sit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees working under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must deal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or mentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car, extraordinarily heavy train that can\u2019t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more common in Europe and will always be with us.\n12\n\nWage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required  to carry many dangerous products every\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words \u201ccommon carrier\u201d define railroad responsibilities.\nLast year BNSF\u2019s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country\u2019s inflation goals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five since our purchase.", "h BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five since our purchase.

Railroads don\u2019t get much attention when they are working but, were they unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as expected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or even bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California\u2019s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii). In such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once regarded as among the most stable industries in America.\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior performance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely be required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that utilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE\u2019s extensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some years from completion.", "generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE\u2019s extensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some years from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the continental United States.\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The \u201cmargin of safety\u201d approach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-return pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such ruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be required but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\n13\n\nAt Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased \u2013 and will likely continue to increase \u2013 if convective storms become more frequent.\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE\u2019s forest-fire losses and can\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously be a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive negative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is risk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere.", "company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive negative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is risk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we will not knowingly  throw good money after bad.\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to adopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many public-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will decide which model they prefer.\nWhen the dust settles, America\u2019s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire\u2019s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (\u201cP/C\u201d) provides the core of Berkshire\u2019s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years and despite our nearly 5,000-fold  increase in volume \u2013 from $17 million to $83  billion  \u2013 we have\nmuch room to grow.\nBeyond that, we have learned \u2013 too often, painfully \u2013 a good deal about what types of\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid . The most important lesson is that our\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can\u2019t be\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\nSurprises  in the P/C business \u2013 which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\npolicies have expired \u2013 are almost always negative. The industry\u2019s accounting is designed to recognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge.", "can occur decades after six-month or one-year\npolicies have expired \u2013 are almost always negative. The industry\u2019s accounting is designed to recognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved, detection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates of future loss payments but inflation \u2013 both monetary and the \u201clegal\u201d variety \u2013 is a wild card.\n14\n\nI\u2019ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\nnewcomers to page 18. Here, I will only repeat that our position would not be what it is if Ajit Jain had not joined Berkshire in 1986. Before that lucky day \u2013 aside from an almost unbelievably wonderful experience with GEICO that began early in 1951 and will never end \u2013 I was largely wandering in the wilderness, as I struggled to build our insurance operation.\nAjit\u2019s achievements since joining Berkshire have been supported by a large cast of\nhugely-talented insurance executives in our various P/C operations. Their names and faces are unknown to most of the press and the public. Berkshire\u2019s lineup of managers, however, is to P/C insurance what Cooperstown\u2019s honorees are to baseball.\nBertie, you can feel good about the fact that you own a piece of an incredible P/C operation\nthat now operates worldwide with unmatched financial resources, reputation and talent. It carried the day in 2023.\nWhat is it with Omaha?\nCome to Berkshire\u2019s annual gathering on May 4, 2024. On stage you will see the three\nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may wonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don\u2019t look alike. Let\u2019s dig deeper.\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire \u2013 and in all respects is\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow \u2013 was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey). In the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me.", "all respects is\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow \u2013 was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey). In the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During that period, I never met him.\nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his\nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I\u2019ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his wife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it\u2019s been more than three decades since they moved to New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived about a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent our early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We didn\u2019t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15 of America\u2019s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts Grover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive. America is a very young country.)\n15\n\nMoving to the corporate level, Berkshire itself relocated in 1970 from its 81 years of\nresidence in New England to settle in Omaha, leaving its troubles behind and blossoming in its new home.\nAs a final punctuation point to the \u201cOmaha Effect,\u201d Bertie \u2013 yes that Bertie \u2013 spent her\nearly formative years in a middle-class neighborhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged as one of the country\u2019s great investors.\nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it.\nBut that\u2019s not true.", "rhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged as one of the country\u2019s great investors.\nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it.\nBut that\u2019s not true. After starting a family in 1956, Bertie was active financially for 20 years: holding bonds, putting\n1\u20443 of her funds in a publicly-held mutual fund and trading stocks with some\nfrequency. Her potential remained unnoticed.\nThen, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided\nto make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during\nthe next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic gifts (think nine figures).\nMillions of American investors could  have followed her reasoning which involved only\nthe common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha. And, taking no chances, Bertie returns to Omaha every  May to be re-energized.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSo what is going on? Is it Omaha\u2019s water? Is it Omaha\u2019s air? Is it some strange planetary\nphenomenon akin to that which has produced Jamaica\u2019s sprinters, Kenya\u2019s marathon runners, or Russia\u2019s chess experts? Must we wait until AI someday yields the answer to this puzzle?\nKeep an open mind. Come to Omaha in May, inhale the air, drink the water and say \u201chi\u201d\nto Bertie and her good-looking daughters. Who knows? There is no downside, and, in any event, you will have a good time and meet a huge crowd of friendly people.\nTo top things off, we will have available the new 4\nth edition of Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack.\nPick up a copy. Charlie\u2019s wisdom will improve your life as it has mine.\nFebruary 24, 2024  Warren E.

Investopedia and Forbes both recommend dollar-cost averaging, modest allocations (roughly 1%\u20135% of the financial portfolio for speculation, 1%\u20137.5% for younger investors), and no leverage until you understand liquidity.

Problem Hamiltonian\n\nEncode the objective function as a quantum Hamiltonian:\n\n```\nH_C = \u03a3\u1d62\u2c7c Q\u1d62\u2c7c Z\u1d62Z\u2c7c\n```\n\nWhere Z\u1d62 are Pauli-Z operators on qubits.\n\n### 2. Mixer Hamiltonian\n\nApply quantum mixing to explore solution space:\n\n```\nH_M = \u03a3\u1d62 X\u1d62\n```\n\nWhere X\u1d62 are Pauli-X operators.\n\n### 3. QAOA Circuit\n\nAlternate between problem and mixer layers:\n\n```\n|\u03c8(\u03b3,\u03b2)\u27e9 = e^(-i\u03b2\u209aH_M) e^(-i\u03b3\u209aH_C) ... e^(-i\u03b2\u2081H_M) e^(-i\u03b3\u2081H_C) |+\u27e9^\u2297n\n```\n\nParameters \u03b3 and \u03b2 are optimized classically.\n\n### 4. Classical Optimization\n\nUse classical optimizer (COBYLA, SPSA) to tune \u03b3 and \u03b2 to minimize:\n\n```\n\u27e8\u03c8(\u03b3,\u03b2)|H_C|\u03c8(\u03b3,\u03b2)\u27e9\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Convert Portfolio Problem to QUBO\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom qiskit_optimization.applications import PortfolioOptimization\n\n# Example: 5 assets\nn_assets = 5\nreturns = np.array([0.05, 0.08, 0.06, 0.09, 0.07])  # Expected returns\ncov_matrix = np.array([...])  # Covariance matrix\nrisk_factor = 0.5  # Risk aversion\nbudget = 1000  # Total investment\n\n# Create QUBO problem\nportfolio = PortfolioOptimization(\n    expected_returns=returns,\n    covariances=cov_matrix,\n    risk_factor=risk_factor,\n    budget=budget\n)\nqubo = portfolio.to_quadratic_program()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Build QAOA Circuit\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import COBYLA\nfrom qiskit.algorithms import QAOA\nfrom qiskit.primitives import Sampler\n\n# Set QAOA parameters\np = 3  # Number of QAOA layers\noptimizer = COBYLA(maxiter=100)\nsampler = Sampler()\n\n# Create QAOA instance\nqaoa = QAOA(sampler=sampler, optimizer=optimizer, reps=p)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve and Extract Solution\n\n```python\n# Run QAOA\nresult = qaoa.compute_minimum_eigenvalue(qubo)\n\n# Extract optimal portfolio\noptimal_weights = portfolio.interpret(result)\nprint(f\"Optimal portfolio: {optimal_weights}\")\nprint(f\"Expected return: {result.eigenvalue}\")\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Classical\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef classical_portfolio(returns, cov, risk_factor):\n    n = len(returns)\n    \n    def objective(w):\n        return -(returns @ w - risk_factor * w @ cov @ w)\n    \n    constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.sum(w) - 1})\n    bounds = tuple((0, 1) for _ in range(n))\n    w0 = np.ones(n) / n\n    \n    result = minimize(objective, w0, method='SLSQP', \n                     bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)\n    return result.x\n\nclassical_weights = classical_portfolio(returns, cov_matrix, risk_factor)\nprint(f\"Classical solution: {classical_weights}\")\n```\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n### Current Limitations\n\n1. **Qubit count**: n assets requires n qubits minimum\n   - IBM Quantum: Up to 127 qubits (127 assets max)\n   - Practical limit with noise: ~20-30 assets\n\n2. **Circuit depth**: Deeper circuits \u2192 more noise\n   - p=1: Shallow, fast, less accurate\n   - p=3-5: Good balance\n   - p>10: Too noisy on current hardware\n\n3. **Optimization landscape**: 2p parameters to optimize\n   - Classical optimization can get stuck in local minima\n   - Multiple runs with random initialization recommended\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Start small**: Test on 5-10 assets first\n2. **Use simulation**: Debug on classical simulator before hardware\n3. **Warm start**: Initialize \u03b3, \u03b2 from previous solutions\n4. **Multiple shots**: Run circuit 1000-10000 times for statistics\n5. **Error mitigation**: Use readout error correction\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### 1.
