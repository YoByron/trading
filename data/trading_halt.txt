TRADING HALTED - Jan 23, 2026

Reason: Churning detected - 35 trades executed instead of 1 iron condor
Daily Loss: -$17.56 from bid/ask spread erosion

Root Causes:
1. guaranteed_trader.py has NO daily limit - buys $100 SPY every run
2. Multiple "FORCE" commits triggered workflows repeatedly
3. claude-agent-utility.yml calls guaranteed_trader without deduplication

Fixes Required:
1. Add daily trade counter to guaranteed_trader.py
2. Remove guaranteed_trader from claude-agent-utility.yml
3. Ensure only 1 iron condor entry per day (4 legs max)

Remove this file to resume trading after fixes are verified.
