=== LL-297: Daily Trade Limit to Prevent Churning (Jan 23, 2026) ===
SEVERITY: CRITICAL
PROBLEM: 21 trades in one day caused $11.29 loss from bid/ask spreads
ROOT CAUSE: Multiple workflow runs, no daily limit, file-based lock doesn't work across runners
FIX APPLIED:
1. Added MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY = 4 (1 iron condor = 4 legs)
2. Added trading_halt.txt check at start of iron_condor_trader.py
3. Created data/trading_halt.txt to halt trading immediately
PREVENTION: Always check trade count before executing. Use halt file for emergencies.
