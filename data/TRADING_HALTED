TRADING HALTED - Jan 23, 2026 12:52 PM ET

EMERGENCY HALT - System still churning despite fixes!

Evidence:
- 48 trades today (was 35, now increased to 48!)
- Daily loss: -$21.16 (was -$17.56)
- System is NOT respecting trade limits

ROOT CAUSE: guaranteed_trader fix not deployed to main
The trading_halt.txt file is not the correct halt mechanism.
Workflows check for data/TRADING_HALTED

PHIL TOWN RULE #1: DON'T LOSE MONEY!

Remove this file ONLY after:
1. Verify all trading scripts have daily limits
2. Confirm no scheduled workflows can execute trades
3. Manual review of all trade execution pathways
