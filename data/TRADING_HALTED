TRADING HALTED - Jan 23, 2026 (Updated with Fixes)

Original Reason: Strategy Violation - System executing wrong trades

Violations detected today (FIXED):
1. ✅ FIXED: Fractional SPY share buying (DCA) - guaranteed_trader.py disabled
2. ✅ FIXED: claude-agent-utility.yml no longer calls guaranteed_trader
3. ⏳ PENDING: Verify iron_condor_trader.py works correctly on Monday

Impact: -$22.61 loss from bid/ask spreads and slippage

CLAUDE.md Strategy (MANDATORY):
- IRON CONDORS on SPY ONLY
- 30-45 DTE, exit at 50% profit or 7 DTE
- HOLD positions for theta decay
- NO fractional share buying
- NO same-day closing of options

Resume Trading:
- Next trading day: Monday, Jan 26, 2026
- Manual verification required before removing this file
- Run: python3 scripts/iron_condor_trader.py --dry-run
