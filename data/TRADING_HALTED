TRADING HALTED - CTO EMERGENCY
===================================
Date: Friday, January 23, 2026 12:20 PM ET
Reason: 4 consecutive days of losses - Rule #1 violated

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- Iron condor CALL legs NOT filling (23 PUT trades, 0 CALL trades)
- Incomplete positions = directional risk = losses
- System is creating PUT-only spreads instead of iron condors

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Fix CALL leg execution before resuming
2. Verify all 4 legs fill before considering trade complete
3. DO NOT trade until root cause is fixed

Resume trading only when:
[ ] CALL legs confirmed to execute
[ ] Full 4-leg iron condor fills in testing
[ ] CTO approval
