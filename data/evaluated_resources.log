Resource: Agentic-R: Learning to Retrieve for Agentic Search (arxiv:2601.11888)
Verdict: FLUFF
Reason: Academic ML research for QA benchmarks. Zero applicability to options trading. Our RAG use case (lesson retrieval) is trivially simple and doesn't need multi-hop reasoning or custom retriever training. Would add massive complexity for zero trading benefit.
