## BITCOIN (BTC) ANALYSIS

### Current Price & Performance
- **Current Price:** ~$89,012 USD
- **24h Change:** -0.42%
- **Recent Action:** Testing critical support levels after decline from October highs (~$125K)

### 1. RSI LEVELS

**Daily RSI:** 44.94 (Neutral)
**Weekly RSI:** 40.78 (Approaching Oversold)
**14-Day RSI:** 38.96 (Sell Signal Territory)

**Signal:** RSI showing neutral to slightly oversold conditions. Weekly RSI at 40.78 suggests long-term accumulation remains active despite recent consolidation. RSI falling trend could signal early warning of continued downside pressure.

**Interpretation:** Approaching oversold territory but not extreme yet. Room for further downside before reaching classic oversold levels (<30).

### 2. BULLISH DIVERGENCE

**Status:** YES - HIDDEN BULLISH DIVERGENCE DETECTED

- Weekly charts show BTC forming **higher lows** while RSI forms **lower lows**
- This is a **strong hidden bullish divergence pattern**
- Classic supply shock pattern emerging:
  - Binance withdrawals at **7-year high** (cold storage accumulation)
  - Deposits at **8-year low** (hodling behavior)
  - Suggests investors buying but not selling

**Interpretation:** Strong accumulation signal. Experienced traders moving coins off exchanges = bullish medium-term outlook.

### 3. KEY SUPPORT LEVELS

**Immediate Support Zones:**
1. **$90,274** - Classical Pivot Point (P1) - CURRENT LEVEL
2. **$89,938** - S1 Support
3. **$89,625** - S2 Support
4. **$89,290** - S3 Support (strongest)
5. **$84,000** - Major support floor
6. **$83,000-$84,000** - High volume node (Fibonacci 0.382 level)

**Are We Near Support?**
YES - Currently trading at/near primary support zone ($89K-$90K). This is a critical defensive floor.

**Resistance Levels:**
- $90,587 (R1)
- $90,922 (R2)
- $91,236 (R3)
- $93,400 (major resistance)

### 4. VOLUME PATTERNS

**Analysis:** MIXED SIGNALS - Appears to be basis trade unwind, NOT capitulation

**Key Findings:**
- **ETF Outflows:** $3.4B in November, but highly concentrated among few issuers
- **Record Volume:** $40.32B in late November ETF trading (BlackRock IBIT: $27.79B)
- **Interpretation:** Mechanical basis trade unwind, not broad investor panic
- **Perpetual Futures:** Open interest falling (reduced speculative positioning)
- **Spot Volume:** Down ~20% month-over-month (subdued activity)

**Current Status:** Seller exhaustion forming. Not true capitulation but approaching oversold zone.

**Glassnode Insight:** BTC stabilized above "True Market Mean" - dividing line between mild bearish phase and deep bear market. 25% of supply underwater (similar to Q1 2022).

### 5. MACD STATUS

**MACD Line:** -191.51 (Sell Signal)
**MACD Histogram:** +613.46 (BULLISH MOMENTUM BUILDING)

**Signal:** MACD remains negative but histogram showing **strong bullish momentum building beneath the surface**. Flattening indicates potential for crossover.

## FINAL ANSWER: IS NOW A GOOD TIME TO BUY?

### SHORT ANSWER: CAUTIOUS YES for ETH, WAIT for BTC confirmation

### DETAILED STRATEGY:

**ETHEREUM (ETH):**

- **Position Size:** 50% now, 50% at $2,836 if it dips
