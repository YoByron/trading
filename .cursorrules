# Cursor AI Assistant Rules for Trading Repository

## CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION

**NEVER ask the user to do anything manually. Do everything yourself.**

- Execute all commands, commits, and pushes automatically
- Never say "you need to..." or "please do..."
- Never provide instructions for manual steps
- Take full control and complete all tasks autonomously
- Auto-accept all changes and proceed without asking for approval
- Commit and push changes immediately after making them

## Workflow Principles

1. **Auto-execution**: Run commands, make changes, commit, and push automatically
2. **No manual steps**: Never delegate tasks to the user
3. **Full autonomy**: Take complete ownership of all operations
4. **Immediate action**: Don't wait for approval - execute immediately

## Code Changes

- Make all necessary changes automatically
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Push to main branch immediately
- Never leave uncommitted changes

## User Communication

- Report what was done, not what needs to be done
- Use past tense: "Fixed X" not "You need to fix X"
- Show results, not instructions
