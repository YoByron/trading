## ⚡ Execution Quality

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Estimated Slippage** | <0.1% | ✅ Tracking... |
| **Fill Rate** | ~100% | ✅ Paper trading |
| **Average Spread Cost** | Tracking... | ⏳ Pending data |
| **Order Latency** | <100ms | ✅ Cloud infrastructure |

**Note**: Execution quality metrics are estimated during paper trading. Real slippage and spread costs will be measured when live trading begins. Fill rate is near 100% in paper trading but may vary in live markets.

**Slippage Sources**:
- Market orders: Bid-ask spread + market impact
- Limit orders: Potential non-fill risk
- Volatility events: Wider spreads during high volatility

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use limit orders for non-urgent entries
- Trade during market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM ET) for better liquidity
- Monitor bid-ask spreads before order submission
- Consider VWAP/TWAP execution for larger positions

## 💰 Tax Optimization & Compliance

**⚠️ CRITICAL FOR LIVE TRADING**: Tax implications can significantly impact net returns. This section tracks capital gains, day trading rules, and tax optimization opportunities.

### Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule Status

✅ Compliant

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Day Trades (Last 5 Days)** | 0 | ✅ |
| **PDT Threshold** | 4+ day trades in 5 days | ✅ SAFE |
| **Minimum Equity Required** | $25,000 | ✅ |
| **Current Equity** | $100,017.49 | ✅ |

**PDT Rule Explanation**: If you make 4+ day trades (same-day entry/exit) in 5 business days, you must maintain $25,000 minimum equity. Violations can result in account restrictions.

### Tax Impact Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Closed Trades** | 0 |
| **Day Trades** | 0 |
| **Short-Term Trades** | 0 |
| **Long-Term Trades** | 0 |
| **Wash Sales** | 0 |
| **Gross Return** | $+0.00 |
| **Estimated Tax Liability** | $+0.00 |
| **After-Tax Return** | $+0.00 |
| **Tax Efficiency** | 100.0% |

**Tax Rates**:
- **Short-Term Capital Gains** (< 1 year): 37% (taxed as ordinary income)
- **Long-Term Capital Gains** (≥ 1 year): 20% (preferred rate)

**Key Tax Strategies**:
1. **Hold positions >1 year** for long-term capital gains rate (20% vs 37%)
2. **Avoid wash sales**: Don't repurchase same security within 30 days of selling at a loss
3. **Tax-loss harvesting**: Realize losses to offset gains before year-end
4. **Mark-to-Market Election (Section 475(f))**: Consider for active traders (treats trading as business income, exempts wash sale rule)

### Tax Optimization Recommendations

✅ **No immediate tax optimization recommendations**


**Important Notes**:
- **Paper Trading**: Tax calculations are estimates. Actual tax liability depends on your tax bracket and state.
- **Wash Sale Rule**: Losses cannot be deducted if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale.
- **Capital Loss Deduction**: Maximum $3,000 capital loss deduction per year (excess carries forward).
- **Day Trading**: Frequent day trading may trigger Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rules requiring $25k minimum equity.
- **Consult Tax Professional**: This is not tax advice. Consult a qualified tax professional before live trading.

**Integration with RL Pipeline**: Tax-aware reward function penalizes short-term gains and rewards long-term holdings to optimize after-tax returns.
