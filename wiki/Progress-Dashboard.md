## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### Critical Warnings

🚨 **NEGATIVE SHARPE RATIO (-16.60)**: Strategy is worse than random. Taking massive risk for minimal reward. Better off with cash in savings account. **Action**: Run post-mortem on every losing trade. Check if entry/exit logic is inverted.

⚠️ **INSUFFICIENT SAMPLE SIZE (0 trades)**: Need 50+ trades before metrics are meaningful. Current win rate 0.0% is statistically insignificant.

⚠️ **FAR FROM TARGET**: $0.15/day vs $100/day target (0.15% of goal). Gap suggests strategy fundamentals need rethinking, not just optimization.

| **Total P/L** | $+5.50 (+0.01%) | TBD | ✅ |

## ⚡ Execution Quality

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Estimated Slippage** | <0.1% | ✅ Tracking... |
| **Fill Rate** | ~100% | ✅ Paper trading |
| **Average Spread Cost** | Tracking... | ⏳ Pending data |
| **Order Latency** | <100ms | ✅ Cloud infrastructure |

**Note**: Execution quality metrics are estimated during paper trading. Real slippage and spread costs will be measured when live trading begins. Fill rate is near 100% in paper trading but may vary in live markets.

**Slippage Sources**:
- Market orders: Bid-ask spread + market impact
- Limit orders: Potential non-fill risk
- Volatility events: Wider spreads during high volatility

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use limit orders for non-urgent entries
- Trade during market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM ET) for better liquidity
- Monitor bid-ask spreads before order submission
- Consider VWAP/TWAP execution for larger positions
